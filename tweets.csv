""why is this guy talking about oppenheimer, john wick 4 and the eras tour movie all being in the same category like itâ€™s a good thing that makes sense"";-1
no i meant like barbie as in the barbie movies the animated ones ğŸ™ i havenâ€™t seen oppenheimer but good for him oppening his heimer;-1
Oppenheimer was a good movie but I feel like the way it jumps around so much makes it hard to really build up scenes the way I wish they had;1
Finally watching Oppenheimer.   And JESUS the Josh Hartnett jump scare was NOT expected but good LORD did that man age like fine wine.   #Oppenheimer #awardsseason #imwaybehindinscreenings;-1
""ONE WEEK till the 29th Annual Critics Choice Awards LIVE Sunday, January 14th, on The CW.  If I had a choice, I feel like the â€œBarbieâ€ table would be a good time during the show. #killersoftheflowermoon #barbiethemovie #oppenheimer #criticschoice #criticschoiceawards"";-1
Oppenheimer is such a good representation of US politics cause itâ€™s like yeah itâ€™s totally fine if you want to build a bomb that might destroy all humanity but you even think about getting teachers to unionize and weâ€™ll fucking kill you;-1
Oppenheimer more like this film is so good I really enjoyed watching it-enheimer;1
Oppenheimer  Very good but only really started being a movie like halfway through. Didn't know the heimer be fucking like that damn.;-1
""REWATCH-#Oppenheimer. My 11yo sonâ€™s review: â€œItâ€™s one of Nolanâ€™s best, though I didnâ€™t like the last hour of politics.â€ Iâ€™m still impressed at how heâ€™s fashioned a biopic to feel like a tense action thriller. That music is insanely good. Seriously good film."";1
""I feel like Dan Dehaan is a bit overlooked in Oppenheimer, he is so good in it!!!"";-1
""""""...â€œOppenheimerâ€ was...the riskiest film we have made...I didnâ€™t feel there was a guaranteed audience...Not only did it feel like it was a risky film to make, it felt like the stakes had never been higher. So the fact we had such a good summer was more gratifying than anything."""""";-1
""Finally got around to watching Oppenheimer and goddamn it was so good, especially the scoring. Was expecting to like it because Iâ€™m such a history nerd but genuinely didnâ€™t expect to be so thoroughly engrossed."";1
If you think this is what good parenting looks like then I highly recommend you get a vasectomy;-1
no earlier i was like this man shouldnâ€™t be third he hasnâ€™t been in anything but oppenheimerâ€¦ then i looked and i was humbled hsndhdhdh good for him i guess ğŸ˜­;-1
RDJ is so wholesome. I wish he gets more and more good roles like in Oppenheimer.;-1

""I like how he went for small Irish indie after Oppenheimer - film adaptation of Claire Keeganâ€™s Small Things Like These, that is already in post-production. But Iâ€™m sure he will do big Hollywood movies too, if the script is good. Marvel - not his kind of thing."";-1

You watching barbie and Oppenheimer 40 times against Jurassic park avengers age of ultron and good will huntingğŸ˜­like WHOS GONNA WINNN;-1
why did cillian enter like einstein in that one scene in oppenheimer;-1
Finally watched Oppenheimer and itâ€™s good like everyone says but I am over these movies being 3 hours. The last 40min was an absolute chore to get through.;1
""lol, maybe they are good, for some reason the opening scene of Oppenheimer just makes the movie look so pretentious,   and then with the Flower Moon one,   I feel like Iâ€™m supposed to be impressed w the cast, but thatâ€™s itâ€¦the whole time Iâ€™m wondering what the heck Iâ€™m watchingâ€¦and for what reasonâ€¦?"";-1
""Bro, people did not like TENET (I am one of them), criticized the hell out of it, and Nolan said alright bet and made OPPENHEIMER. Criticism isn't bad. It's necessary. """"Good"""" Criticism btw."";-1
""there's a bittersweet feeling inside of me like i know awards are just the cherry on top of one's body of work but why did it take so long for him to receive his flowers he's literally one of the most talented actors in the world, i just hope he gets good projects from now on"";-1
Oppenheimer probably wouldnâ€™t get made since the estate doesnâ€™t like him being depicted as anything but a paragon of good and virtue;-1
""Apart from how good looking he is , I like how confident he speaks . ğŸ¤ŒğŸ¾"";-1
""Finally watched Oppenheimer last evening and it was good.  I think youâ€™ll like it, John, if you have not seen it yet."";1
""Good to see another media outlet covering this. But nothing so far from outlets like the New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, NPR etc. This is irresponsible, as the President is speaking about the pandemic in past tense without a fact-check.  https://www.salon.com/2024/01/04/leader-says-19-is-still-a-pandemic/"";-1
""ron, here i have to disagree;-1";" good people do not commit atrocities. only evil people, dressed to look like good people, commit atrocities."
His hair looked so good like this idc;-1
The Upanishads are a good start... I could link you to the English translation I read if you like.  Oppenheimer studied Sanskrit so he could get deeper into these texts lol.  I'm starting to consider doing the same.. ğŸ¤”;-1
""nah man i just saw someone post all of Oppenheimer, like all three hours, and in insanely good quality"";1
Will it be good Cinema like an Oppenheimer or will it be like Barbie?;-1
y'all get one good live action adaptation and already act like mcu stans;-1
""@BestBuy good job,After choosing to remove 4k Blu-rayâ€™s and Discs in store and online  like #Oppenheimer Iâ€™m done shopping at your stores. Good luck with your baffling decisions.  #BestBuy #dead"";-1
""Honestly Oppenheimer was really really good, like, artistry, very well told story, clever writing and editing But its not my kind of movie Crazy how much they crammed into three hours 10/10"";1
""I watched Barbie in theaters instead of Oppenheimer and I enjoyed it. I think it was well-made, very competently acted and had a good pace. The whiny men who complained about it boiled down to """"WAHH! I don't like feminism in my movies!"""""";-1
""Coach Thibodeau describes newcomer Knicks PF Precious Achiuwa as â€œa good young playerâ€, â€œversatileâ€, â€œable to play multiple positionsâ€, and said that â€œwe like the fact that he can improve, heâ€™s young, so his development will continue.â€"";-1
""I view this, which are similar to my thoughts on science - akin to a religion. I have great respect for science, but I don't do almost any calculations myself. I use my judgment of who is a good scientist and how well that science is respected to form my views.  Much like we did with priests before science.  It's a far superior system to religion in most practical senses.. but itn't totally superior to philosophy IMO. There are limits to what it can solve, and the lack of recognition of how far we can get with a science/engineering view needs reconciliation with philosophy and values/morals.   Which is what spawned my article/thread :)"";-1
I sense the same pain from people now trying to watch Oppenheimer. Like its good but I fully understand if you quit after 20mins ğŸ¤£;-1
""As I lie in bed sick, this seems like a good time to list my top 5s from 2023.  Top 5 Favorite Movies:  5) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 4) Joy Ride 3) Oppenheimer 2) Suzume 1) Godzilla Minus One"";1
just watched the batman a second time since cinema and itâ€™s kinda drawn out for no good reason like itâ€™s the same time as oppenheimer ish and i watched that just before and it flew by the batman drags a little;-1
Oppenheimer was good but it felt like a movie you would watch in history class while taking notes ğŸ˜­ like i was confused 60% of the time but the movie was good;1
This list was made up of films I really liked mixed with films that are just objectively very good. Also I considered which movies Im going to watch again and again like Scream VI and movies Ill only watch once or twice like Oppenheimer;-1
""It was literally really good??? I think it was the best movies made this year, idk why u are so rudely defensive about it. People can like or hate things, u seemingly hate it but i personally found it a very good and well paced movie. The movie was showing Oppenheimerâ€™s POV btw."";-1
""universal: hey guys heres some community driven movies for YOU the fans (fnaf and mario)! were also gonna drop some more """"film"""" movies for the people who like to analyse and review (oppenheimer) :)  *starts doing really fucking good*  disney: (theyve been going off brand recog)"";-1
""I really need to watch more movies from last year, In 2022 I had like 5 movies that I really loved and were all fighting for the top spot imo.  This year I have Oppenheimer, Godzilla minus 1 and maybe ATSV. I've seen like no good 2023 movies"";1
I watch good movies like Oppenheimer on my big ultra  hd TV with blue tooth speakers from my comfortable recliner on streaming these days;-1
It sucks so much because there are still a good amount of people who would like to purchase physical media. Oppenheimer is a good example of people still want to buy physical media. The DVDs sold out in a day!;-1
""i donâ€™t even mind people who have the genetic top 4, like 2001. oppenheimer, whiplash and TDK, itâ€™s just when theyâ€™re close minded is when it sucks. like yeah those movies are good but why donâ€™t you watch like a Lynch film or something. and sometimes they will go ahead and watch"";-1
DAWG this Oppenheimer is good but the beef that scientist be having with each other is like reality TV level ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­;1
""pretty good time for biopics like Oppenheimer, Ferrari and Priscilla!"";1
""Emily Blunt on working with Christopher Nolan in #Oppenheimer:  â€œHe has very expressive hair. For some reason when heâ€™s happy, I feel like his hair kinda vibrates a bit. When heâ€™s thrilled with a take, his hair will dance and he will say: right good, happy? moving on!â€"";-1
""Top 5 films of '23, hmmm...  1. Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse 2. Godzilla -1 3. Oppenheimer 4. Barbie 5. The Holdovers  I said Asteroid City was mid but I still enjoyed it. I think I just expected more, like with Boy and Heron. KOFlower Moon was also good."";1
""You replied to multiple people saying you're not going to watch any movies. Modern cinema is dead. Just games and classics now. Then say you're looking forward to a 2023 monster movie. Hyperbolic much? Maybe you didn't like Oppenheimer, fine, but good movies are still being made."";-1
""For perspective, the profit Guardians 3 made was enough to easily fund 8 of the 10 best picture favorites this year (incl. Oppenheimer). Movies like that don't get made unless they have other movies that generate a ridiculous amount of profit. That's what pays for the good films."";-1
""I like ranking stuff so here's my favourite movies of 2023: 1) Talk to Me 2) The Holdovers 3) Oppenheimer 4) When Evil Lurks 5) Guardians 3 6) A Good Person 7) Scream 6 8) Saw X 9) Thanksgiving  Didn't see a lot of the """"good"""" ones though."";1
""26. Oppenheimer   It was good but despite having nuance, I did feel it teetered too closely to being one-sided. Brilliant sound design. Also felt very obviously like a movie *made* to win awards."";-1
""I donâ€™t get why Oppenheimer was viewed so favourably. I found it to be one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Something no one talks about is how fake and unrelatable dialogue is.  Only good part was the test explosion: suddenly, you felt like you were actually there, because no one had badly written dialogue and the atmosphere came across well. Rest of the movie was terrible."";0
I watch a lot of British and Australian tv. Mostly just good fun and interesting (I like the police procedurals). Last two movies I watched in the theatre was Oppenheimer and Top Gun: Maverick. I used to go to movies a lot but theyâ€™re mostly crap nowâ€¦ ğŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸;-1
""This feels like a list created for contrarian and content purposes. I could understand if a lot of these toed the line between good and bad, but when you're throwing stuff like JW4, Oppenheimer, and Killers on her, it comes off as disingenuous."";-1
I donâ€™t like history and I thought Oppenheimer was pretty good. I agree it was a little long but outside of that it was great;1
oppenheimer is actually one of the best films i've ever seen. it's not overrated at all like it's just so good;1
I think youâ€™ll like it - itâ€™s actually more about the man & women in his life than the cars   Itâ€™s not Oppenheimer good (but shorter) but I preferred it to Napoleon (but some of the battles were amazing);-1
watch something good like Oppenheimer;1
""â€œHappy New Year and Good Health!â€ Paul, as they say here;-1";" you are leading the fight of a life for a habitable planet:our opponents are + powerful,+rich,+ dangerous too, itâ€™s true, but we, we can never say like Oppenheimer: â€œNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worldsâ€"
i loved oppenheimer like i'm sorry but it was just so good!;1
""[Oppenheimer (Movie Theatre)]  Okay I watched this way earlier in the year and I totally forgot to include it my bad. It was crazy and good, worth the hype. Didnâ€™t think I would like it as much as I did but itâ€™s pretty kino stuff."";-1
""Let's talk films, movies, the pictures! Here are my favorite 4 of 2023. Oppenheimer takes the came as a culmination of Nolan's career. For the record I don't even like Nolan but this film vibrates. The other three are so good you should go see them ASAP"";-1
""Back again for 2023! Again fell well short of my goal of seeing 100 movies but some good stuff nonetheless: Ikiru, Some Like It Hot, Oppenheimer, Blade Runner 2049, Say Anything, The Apartment, Passion of Joan of Arc, Barbie, Asteroid City, A Beautiful Mind, My Neighbor Totoro"";-1
""Been a good year hasn't it the old telly film and games?  Barbie, Oppenheimer, Across the Spider-Verse, John Wick 4, MI: Dead Reckoning, Alan Wake 2, From, The Last of Us, Succession. All top, top drawer."";-1
""I think that the communist politics are a major red-herring because I had to watch twice to come to my current view of the film. The first time around, I thought the direction and plot were pretty good, but was also too disgusted at Oppenheimerâ€™s communism to â€œlikeâ€ the movie."";-1
""Honestly: What do you, people, find so good about Oppenheimer? There should be an â€˜American onlyâ€™ tag in films like this, that doesnâ€™t have ANY MEANING AT ALL for the rest of the world. Pretty much like â€˜The World Seriesâ€™ of American Baseball. Highly overrated film!"";0
Fuck ya go vue chesite oaks get fucked over like Oppenheimer release turn escalators ofc dumb stupid fucks init Snyder see y I'm not looking good socials but I'm really nice can't cope this barrage shit of jealousy;-1
""Not a person I trust less to give good insight to film than Ben Shapiro, a guy so reactionary he went out and bought a bunch of Barbie toys to burn because he thought the movie was â€œtoo wokeâ€ yet so dumb to enjoy Oppenheimer which actively portrays guys like him as monsters"";-1
""hmmmmm. the batmans donâ€™t feel super unique but i still like them. the action scenes are so good! but yes, he is the oppenheimer of the flavorless superhero movie"";-1
next up Oppenheimer!! I couldnâ€™t go to the premiere so I went to see it in the best format possible at the science museum!! kinda fitting tbh but also itâ€™s really good ğŸ˜Š my friends didnâ€™t like it but I was so invested that I didnâ€™t realise that the 3hrs runtime was done;-1
Hi Gurdeepâ€¦ that sounds like a great plan. We will stay in & watch something as well. We watched Oppenheimer this week & it was really good! Have a lovely 2024!!;1
Oppenheimer was good but it felt like an incredibly long trailer to me;1
""Oppenheimer was no good.  Just overhyped. Everyone in the hall was like, should have gone for Barbie insteadğŸ¤£ No one was recommending it.  Not great."";0
""yes, Oppenheimer was physicist and i want to watch a movie about him. it's good, long and suspensefulğŸ˜ºHolland had a queen before the king, a lady, Beatrix.What I meant was,I don't like the way history is rewritten to suit current trends. Netflix """"likes"""" to subtly rewrite reality"";-1
At times it was. You gotta understand I'm usually intoxicated when I watch wrestling witch makes me like it more and also I have a bias where if I give something my time I'm more inclined to like it.      I just walk out of movies if they aren't good lol. Oppenheimer.;-1
""I'm especially sick of seeing this trend of people acting like they're better people for having seen Godzilla and not Oppenheimer.   They're both good movies, and both deserve praise."";1
""A lot of the show was actually good from an entertainment perspective, I just know that nearly everyone who watches it is going to think everything in the show is historically accurate and have the wrong picture about certain things. It's making me rethink if I like Oppenheimer"";-1
Top 5 movies this year 1. Anatomy of a fall 2. Oppenheimer 3. Monster 4. Dumb money 5. Suzume/Talk to me  Yet to see the holdovers or blackberry. Killers of flower moon was good but I just couldnâ€™t like it as much as the others.;1
""I only went once, and that was for Oppenheimer so itâ€™s obviously my number 1. But it would likely be anyway. I bought it on Blu-ray, too, cos itâ€™s that good. I fancy that Bill Nighy one, Living (or something like that) and thereâ€™s places here showing in English this weekend"";1
""Barbie (2023)  I really loved this. I saw it twice this year, once with my friends and once with my family. I saw this after Oppenheimer and, while I expected to like it more, I didn't expect it to be as good of a satire as it is. Ryan Gosling NEEDS to be in more comedies.   8/10"";-1
SO MANY! I'm totally overwhelming myself with this decision. It's too much! TOO MUCH! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ¤£ Right now I'm sitting here like do I really want to first time watch Oppenheimer as my pick. This isn't a feel good film.;0
""Thereâ€™s bad Oscar bait and thereâ€™s good Oscar bait. Still havenâ€™t seen Meastro. But like Oppenheimer and Poor Things are great Oscar bait this year, IMO. She Said was awful Oscar bait. Itâ€™s a useless critical term."";-1
is oppenheimer really that good or are people being ott about it like they were about barbie;-1
""Good, every nolan movie is a great movie to me Oppenheimer is not my fav of his too but it was really good written and was a spectacle as always, Barbie was fun but I loved Lady Bird more. didn't much like MI DR P1 it felt very convoluted and Fallout was way better"";-1
6. Oppenheimer is really good. Do I need to say more? You all saw this. Murphy embodies the role and the breakneck editing plays like poetry that whisks you along and keeps you glued to the screen. The scene with Blunt and Pugh in the interrogation room had my jaw on the floor;1
I feel like 2023 has been so good that any one of my top 5 could be my number 1 film of the year:  Asteroid City Godzilla: Minus One John Wick: Chapter 4 Killers of the Flower Moon Oppenheimer;1
""baby i donâ€™t think you understand the amount of artistry, creativity and word u have to put on a good mv without relying on green screens like taylor has been doing since reputation. this is like comparing marvel movies to oppenheimer"";-1
Looks like the boys over at Deutsche Bank and Oppenheimer did a pretty good job.;-1
""The problem with Oppenheimer is it has JR saying something like """"[Soviet] neutrality wasn't good enough""""  Soviets weren't neutral. They were Hitler's ally, right up until he stabbed them in the back. At which point they switched sides, involuntarily as @DarthPutinKGB put it"";-1
I never watched it tbh I count that as a flex lmao but I remember you saying Oppenheimer wasnâ€™t good smth like?;-1
""I get it. I guess itâ€™s like with Oppenheimer, technically speaking that movie is pretty much a masterpiece but I could never sit through it againâ€¦ or itâ€™s like reading a really good book but itâ€™s just not one of those that Iâ€™ll likely revisit."";-1
""oppenheimer did not feel like it was 3 hrs long, thatâ€™s how u know it was good"";1
Oppenheimer is like film of the decade tier it's so fucking good;1
""Jokes apart #Maestro is an average watch..there were many good Biopics made in Hollywood like Bohemian Rhapsody, Oppenheimer,Wolf of Wall Street,Moneyball,Ford vs Ferrari and even Air... sadly it doesn't make it's place in that elite list."";-1
@JohnnyBTampa @JohnnyBshow the hold overs were about some kids who didn't go home for the holidays. Yeah didn't see it. Godzilla was born from the bomb and it's probably good if you like Godzilla old school. I know why Oppenheimer is no1 it was a mistake to order.;-1
When Hollywood releases good movies like Oppenheimer and Barbie people go to the theaters.ğŸ¿ğŸ¦ğŸŸï¸ğŸ¥ Just seen migration it was a great movie for the kids they really enjoyed it.;1
No movie is perfect cuz yâ€™all were blabbering for weeks about how good Barbie and Oppenheimer was when in reality Oppenheimer was boring af and Barbie plays like an episode of SNL with the same characters.;-1
You and I could make an entertaining review show based on our disagreements. I felt like Oppenheimer was good but not really my cup of tea.;1
""Some of these are adaptations like Oppenheimer, so not really original. But you still right tho, there are good original movies and unique ones like Beau is afraid."";-1
I've come to the conclusion that if it's a film about something most don't know about so they are learning about the tragedy and it makes you feel for the victims it's good but Oppenheimer looks like it makes you feel for bomb maker atleast in the trailers which feels gross to me;-1
""Oh, you guys. Barbie was the far superior of the three films. And Iâ€™ve seen all of them. I didnâ€™t like my straw because it was kind of masturbatory. And I thought Oppenheimer was two or three really good films and someone needed to edit it."";-1
""Respectfully I just don't think it will work, feels like the movie would be making excuses for what he did, i just don't want that, the Oppenheimer point was good tho."";1
I was watching Oppenheimer and everything was all good until my dad walked in stayed there for like a min and then the sex scene came on like really bro;1
""And even when there's a movie that breaks the mold, and is actually good. It's dismissed for either failing at the box office, being """"risky"""", or doesn't win the so called """"Academy award"""". So far we've had great movies like Oppenheimer, Barbie, Godzilla Minus One, Scream 6, etc."";-1
""ranked all the 2023 releases i watched this year. really didnâ€™t like evil dead rise and mario was purely â€œpretty good!â€ but the rest were all bangers so they were tough to rank. oppenheimer was always #1 though, movieâ€™s a certified all-timer"";-1
People like this drive me insane. Good originals Iâ€™ve seen that were released this year:  Air Polite Society Asteroid City Joy Ride Barbie Oppenheimer Theater Camp Killers of the Flower Moon The Holdovers Saltburn Poor Things Maestro  And there are many that I havenâ€™t seen.;-1
""I donâ€™t think I could list a handful of movies that I like more - itâ€™s that good. Just a TON of supporting cast members who are acting at their absolute peak.   If Oppenheimer doesnâ€™t win best picture at the Oscars, itâ€™s a travesty."";1
""take this year alone. Did you find Oppenheimer to be a likable dude? Cillian Murphy did an incredible job in portraying an extremely boring genius that showed no personality or character ever, and he really did a good job cause that's what the real man looks like in interviews"";1
girl not they sayin Barbie isnâ€™t as good as Oppenheimer like that was NAWT the point??;-1
""- I don't wanna spoil it but what Loki does in the last episode man... - Oppenheimer was not a movie i thought i would like but i did very much, amazing sound design and amazingly directed.  - Sonic Prime S2 wins because it is a good Sonic related piece of media and i love Sonic"";-1
""FYI - Since this tradition began in 2018, heâ€™s always included the actual or expected Best Picture Oscar winner. Good news for Oppenheimer, unless it ends up like Roma or Power of the Dog.  Precedent indicates that only 38% (5) of these films will be nominated for Oscars at all."";-1
""A thousand and 1, Oppenheimer, anatomy of a fall and blackberry are the only good ones. But I actually donâ€™t hate this list. Feels like an actual personâ€™s taste rather than something put together by a committee"";-1
""books: been reading the first few books in the earthsea series, that shit slaps movies: Oppenheimer was so good, like genuinely incredible other shit: the bear is so so so so good"";1
""I was going to be meaner, but I personally feel like this year has been an incredibly good year for original films critically at least.  Films like Oppenheimer and Killers Of The Flower Moon have gotten a lot of praise and attention, and that's just naming two."";1
""Even ignoring elons reply the other guy is talking like we didnâ€™t just get Barbie Oppenheimer and Godzilla minus 1 which were all great original films, this idea that thereâ€™s no good original films being released is dumb"";-1
Oppenheimer should be runaway favorite.  Itâ€™s an amazing cinematic experience.  Barbie was good too.   Killers of the Flower Moon just too damn long to even start.  Havenâ€™t seen Maestro but it looks like a typical auto biography - watered down;1
I want to see Oppenheimer.Looked like a good with the reviews and previews I have seen;1
""It's still good tbh. I can only name 5-6 films like Oppenheimer, The Killer, Past Lives, Sleep & 2 Indian films. That's it ğŸ¤­"";-1
Why'd you all lie and tell me Oppenheimer was a good movie?! Dogshit pacing. No breath. Just pingpongs from line to line. No time for anyone to have a single thought or feeling. Felt like I was watching a 3 hour trailer. Quoting Krishna while deep in a girl's guts was too much ğŸ˜­;0
The dog has been wanting to see Oppenheimer for a while so tonight seems like a good night.;-1
It's like he's trying to undo all the good work of Oppenheimer with a single sentence.;-1
Why the fuck are people using Godzilla to shit on Openheimer? Theyâ€™re both very different movies and are both really fucking good. Like. Genuinely if you use Godzilla to shit on Oppenheimer STFU.;1
I donâ€™t like Oppenheimer thus I donâ€™t like Good Cinema ğŸ˜³â€¦this community and its gatekeeping is on another level. #Cinema #yikes #Movies;-1
""Just because it didnt happen doesn't mean it couldnt.  Youre acting like this Oppenheimer wasn't a 9 figure budget.  Same with barbie, which is also the first """"real"""" movie made off a beloved toy IP.  The fact that they were also *GOOD* is the reason they did well."";-1
""#208 Godzilla Minus One (9/10)  Godzilla movies can be incredible actually from its post-WW2 Japan themes to Godzilla's on screen presence, everything just blended well together.   Also the soundtrack was incredible.  I think I like it more than Oppenheimer, it was THAT good."";-1
yo u can like pikmin 4 more. thatâ€™s reasonable and healthy and good. but itâ€™s not better than oppenheimer letâ€™s be real here;-1
That Jackson Hayes bricked free throws sounded like Oppenheimer good Jesus;-1
""I sobbed like a BABY. godzilla was so so SO GOOD. zero criticism, no notes, 10000/10  i loved oppenheimer too but those memes that are like the son beats the father??? ABSOLUTELY TRUE. UNIRONICALLY MY FAV MOVIE THIS YEAR. EVEN OVER ATSV.   everyone needs to watch G-1. phenomenal.""1
""My gf got me fancy athleisure pants bc i work from home, a massage gun,  the oppenheimer screenplay AND a waterpik  My dad got me a household tool kit, a new air compressor for my cars tires and a giants hat   Good haul i feel like an adult with all this practical shit lol"";-1
""Chinese are free to watch Western movies, they just don't want to. Except when the movie is good-- like Oppenheimer, which did make significant money in China.  Chinese movies are pretty good these days, but they're made for Chinese audiences. You wouldn't be able to understand them, even with subtitles."";-1
""The frustrating thing about 3+ hour movies is that even if they're really good, I can never find the time to watch them again. I wanna watch Oppenheimer and The Batman again but, like, when"";-1
""The power of meme advertising. Like Oppenheimer was good, and as a fan of historical dramas, I loved it. But it's definitely not billion-dollars good. It's not even top 3 Nolan films, IMO. It rode that Barbenheimer wave all the way to the bank."";1
""I watched Oppenheimer and my life felt like it got better, I watched KOFM and I was like yeah Scorsese is good but that is it.  The score on Oppenheimer is enough seğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚"";-1
""Oppenheimer, 1945.   Iâ€™m here thinking, use â€˜em. Look at us without them. Look how much hate we hold. Fuck us. We deserve nothing. Yâ€™all wearing rose coloured glasses finding one good thing and acting like it trumps this bs. No. We suck. Deal. #isaidwhatisaid #tellyourselflies"";-1
I know itâ€™s been said to death but EVERY SINGLE line in Oppenheimer is the best line reading ever itâ€™s insane itâ€™s genuinely baffling and thatâ€™s not even like the best part of the movie which is even more insane but god damn I wish I could make something that cool and good;1
""many months late, i finished oppenheimer and barbie  oppenheimer was good, barbie was actually like right up my alley  my mom did not like barbie at all ROFLLLlL"";1
LOVED Maestro and yet canâ€™t find a good reason from those who didnâ€™t like it. Itâ€™s a film not an article about him that one needs to leave theatre knowing about his life. Films are informative pieces.  Itâ€™s rather unfair that itâ€™s released in a year with Oppenheimer. Before...;-1
""Oppenheimer was good, but it was so overly dramatic, and I wanted tk die every time someone said some shit like, """"Oppie fucks the space  between the atoms"""" or whatever."";1
""Roger that.  More synergy on film releases will definitely help with marketing.    Hopefully AMC / WB can collaborate on a release cadence like that in the future ... Barbie/Oppenheimer, while more-so organic, is a good example of cost effective marketing."";-1
Oppenheimer  My mother got bored last week and we watched the last hour of this movie just now if that gives you an idea  Some good scenes are in it along with some very dry spells where Iâ€™m just squinting for shots of actors I like in the background;-1
Heâ€™s not a threat he was good but cillian performance in Oppenheimer is iconic like Brando in the godfather or Hopkins in sotl;-1
""Pretty good pretty good.   For context for anyone reading, @JGODYT and I went to see Oppenheimer when it came out. But we got evacuated with like 15 minutes left and I never went back to see the ending"";1
""oppenheimer is good but when hartnett says â€œyouâ€™re not just self-important, youâ€™re actually importantâ€  we audibly started laughing at a massive Imax showing, and there were like 7 other groups in different corners of the theater who had the same reactionâ€”shout out yall."";1
Cillian should win. He sounded exactly like Oppenheimer. Looks almost like him too. I mean he portrayed the guilt sooooooo good;-1
""7. oppenheimer  people have talked this movie to death i have no new insight to share about this one, itâ€™s just good af idk. monster ensemble cast and on the technical side just on a whole other level, not to sound too much like a nerd"";-1
#PoorThings is every bit as good (and weird) as youâ€™ve heard. Emma Stone continues to prove she is the best young actress of this generation. Mark Ruffallo is a god damned riot. The whole film looks like a living/moving storybook. Itâ€™s up there with Oppenheimer for best of year;-1
""If you expect it to be a biopic like Oppenheimer, youâ€™ll be disappointed. I found it to be an interesting character study about the relationship between to people with two really good performances"";-1
""No bro,it's a good movie on unique topic which we had no idea about,  one can't compare 3 idiots pk with dunki like how inception, interstellar is better than Oppenheimer or tenet. It's crossed all drama genre movie released after pandemic rakshabandhan,kkbkkj,rrkpk,tjmm,spkk etc"";1
""bradley was good in maestro, it's a showy role so it's like. yeah he wants it. i don't think he's getting it. cillian has ALWAYS been good and oppenheimer is his least interesting role ever. sorry about it. and then paul giamatti absolutely crushes it in the holdovers. team paul!"";-1
""Agreed and with all due respect for streaming services during the pandemic, it was time Cinemas came back. I know for a fact, movies like Oppenheimer werenâ€™t made for streaming services. Itâ€™s just the overall experience, even movies that werenâ€™t good are still enjoyed in theatres"";-1
To some extent I do this. I have favorites that I can admit aren't as good as movies I wouldn't count as a favorite. Like just off the top I'll say Scott Pilgrim is a favorite. Oppenheimer is better. Oppenheimer wouldn't make a favorite movies list of mine.;-1
cillianâ€™s performance is so good in part bc it doesnâ€™t feel like heâ€™s playing a caricature of oppenheimer but a character of the films own making;-1
""Such a relief. After Hollywood big bangs like Oppenheimer, Napoleon, Maestro with every conventional big $ available good to see â€œFallen Leavesâ€ on la condition humaine today. Exposes state of working class without Ken Loach preaching, filming by numbers. Terrific film"";-1
""ok ive never watched any of the christmas romcoms on netflix... is there any good one in there? like non-cringy, non-sibling chemistry, halfway decent cute story? pls give me recs or i'll end up rewatching oppenheimer on christmas ğŸ˜­"";-1
The path from Inception to Interstellar to Tenet is very clear. Just like the path from Dunkirk to Oppenheimer. I much prefer Dunkirk to Oppenheimer.  He also makes good Batman movies which I enjoy.;-1
""I marvel at how actor can interchange between roles , Iâ€™m watching Florence Pugh in this movie â€œA Good Personâ€ and Iâ€™m like this canâ€™t be the same woman I saw in Oppenheimer and Black Widow , like wow"";-1
""I like Oppenheimer as much as the next guy, but there are good superhero movies and bad superhero movies like with any genre, theyâ€™re not competing for space with, of all things, fucking biopics, and a few flops doesnâ€™t mean the genre is dead!"";-1
""Personally for me I enjoyed Oppenheimer more than KOTFM. Oppenheimer was 3hrs but it didn't feel like it was. Barbie I deleted it after I saw some scenes, didn't bother."";1
""Nah I'm officially calling for a ban on women talking about pop culture. In a year where we had Oppenheimer, KOTFM, Godzilla -1, Spiderverse, Barbie (I didn't like it but it was still good), TOTK, Baldur's Gate 3, OPLA and tons of other GOATED stuff, they still call it the worst."";-1
I like how Nolan just made an action movie out of Oppenheimer ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ good stuff;1
""I rewatched it before Oppenheimer came out, it's really good. I like how much detail there is. It's a thoughtfully made movie that is very thrilling IMO"";1
A while ago I watched this masterpiece for the third time  (movie Oppenheimer)how the hell is this movie so good. I just like it more and more every time.They really deserve to win all the Oscars especially Killian and Robert they are just amazing. masterpiece of masterpieces! ğŸ¬;1
""I do wonder if matt damon will sneak into supporting actor at the oscars, like he's really fucking good in oppenheimer and the academy likes him"";-1
""Oppenheimer  Just a very good, tense, and fascinating political thriller with absolutely top notch acting, score and cinematography. Never wouldâ€™ve expected a film like this to hit it big in the mainstream but Iâ€™m glad it did"";1
No you can like movies that are objectively bad and don't like movies that are objevtively good. For exemple Oppenheimer is a good movie but not everyone likes it;1
""I have now watched Barbie, Maestro, and Oppenheimer all in the same week and it seems like for a year I was interested in maybe 1% of movies that came out, we did get 3 good ones."";-1
""finished oppenheimer was as good as a biography can get why Nolan still has a job is beyond me like we get it, you have a problem with time  Also fuck cameos it's always like, here's this person you saw in this other movie as well hollywood should die"";-1
i know oppenheimer is going to win this and i admit that the trinity test scene sound was good. but the sound mixing overall (like most nolan films) was not that good;-1
""The Holdovers: 9/10   Saw the trailer for this when I went to watch Oppenheimer and thought it was interesting, how right I was. This movie is really good with the three best performances from the lead characters. I really like this and will be rewatching a lot."";-1
""Um even if itâ€™s good (I havenâ€™t seen it so I have no opinion) it seems like a stretch to call it that in a year where we have Killers of the Flower Moon, Oppenheimer, Barbie etc.   Also itâ€™s annoying that my Smart TV plays ads at the top of the home page now"";-1
Dawg do you know how good of a movie you have to be to stand out on the premiering weeks of Barbie and Oppenheimer???? On stream as well like the fuck??;1
""I am sorry, why is good public infrastructure a problem?? The percentage of people using it will increase over time. It will also spur growth. The alternative is a """"shared misery"""" model like NK or Cuba (or pre-90s India)."";-1
""Lol, the whole backbone of BVS was the showdown between Batman and Superman. (It's literally in the title) BvS is an action movie.  Ryan Gosling hasn't topped his performance on Drive and La la land. Be calming downğŸ˜‚. RDJ was good in Oppenheimer idk why you didn't like him."";-1
He's gaining fame from Oppenheimer but I remember him from Red Eye. He was the bad guy there but he was too good-looking I got distracted. Seems like a happy family man irl;-1
""It's like when Oppenheimer came out and people """"realized"""" Downey is a good actor   He's always been good (even in some of the MCU stuff)....these people's palette of movies is just very limited"";-1
This is how filmmakers lose credibility. You're a good director with a solid fanbase but pretentious posts like these don't help you. Even Coppola acknowledged both #Oppenheimer & #KillersofTheFlowerMoon as the best of '23 (he prob hasn't seen #TheHoldovers yet). So quit trolling;-1
""OR  The other takeaway from this is that if your non franchise and very original production is really, really good, like Oppenheimer, it will easily score out repetitive franchises and unoriginal content.  So just make good, original content."";-1
Itâ€™s honestly weird to watch this film after seeing Oppenheimer and TÃ¡r this year cos itâ€™s like a meld of them bothâ€¦but not quite as good;0
tbh the only nolan film i had any kind of sound mixing issues with is tenet. interstellar and oppenheimer are both fine imo like they're both loud but in a good way. i couldn't hear a single word of tenet tho;-1
""It is very good. I've been dipping into it, to follow up details in the film. For example, I'd like to find out more about Boris Pash (Affleck), who deserves a film in his own right, from fighting in WWI to his time in CIA #Oppenheimer #BorisPash #CaseyAffleck #AmericanPrometheus"";-1
""Its really based on what you like, Cause i prefer a funny story like i think superbad is better then oppenheimer and that is just cause i prefer a funny story over a serious one and its prolly the same for this guy as well. I still think 4 is good but 5 is just top tier for me"";-1
""I didn't find myself engaged by Oppenheimer's drama. The auditorium scene was good though, wish there were more like it"";-1
""Aight thatâ€™s just untrue. As good as Oppenheimer was and how it surpassed expectations at the box office mario was the big kids movie with barely any competition and not to mention all the YouTube kids slop that it spawned, mario was objectively talked about more like undeniably"";-1
4/5 Oppenheimer a good movie but kind of feels like a circle jerk of morality;1
""This is like when film snobs were like, â€œFinally, after all these years of those goddamn Marvel films, Robert Downey Jr. is being appreciated for CINEMA.â€ Like no one knew he was a good actor before Oppenheimer."";-1
""So if Max doesn't like Marvel films but loved Oppenheimer and the latest flick from Jonathan Glazer, then he is immature.  Why do you need Max Verstappen to like this film?   You don't even know if it's any good..."";-1
Apparently this movie will be contending with Oppenheimer for the Oscarâ€™s.  How dare Clooney be a white supremacist?  Looks like it may be a good movie though.;-1
""You don't even like Oppenheimer, you can't really judge a good film, let alone a Superman movie."";-1
Except itâ€™s not good enough for me to sit through 4 hours again like how Oppenheimer is good and I want to watch it all the time;-1
""Chill dawg, it might be good or even great, don't compare it with real life cinema stuff like Oppenheimer or John Wick, it's in a different league"";-1
""If anyone feels like delving deeper into volcanoes with the eruption of Iceland's volcano, Mountains of Fire by Clive Oppenheimer looks good. I bought a copy tonight. I noticed 2 1*reviews which were about vendors and misplaced orders, but all other reviews are excellent!"";-1
Iâ€™m not even that big on oppenheimer but saying cillianâ€™s performance isnâ€™t as good as paul giamatti in the holdovers is wildâ€¦ like you canâ€™t compare the two;-1
""haven't been film twittering so much cuz the platform blows now. so some rapid-fire awards season takes: - oppenheimer is the first nolan I actually like. but it's like, really fucking good.  - the holdovers: incredible performances. shame payne is a creep!"";-1
Oppenheimer is so interesting like this is such a good movie;1
""Been a great year for movies, probably comes off as lame or whatever but or genuinely makes me very happy how well great movies like Oppenheimer, kotfm and godzilla have all done this year. Makes me feel very good about the short term future of film."";1
""I think I do like Oppenheimerâ€™s pace a bit more."";1
""https://piped.video/SLPXJuJRbi8?si=CzUZW63vyg0-02ww Honestly forgot how good the Truman scene was. Also, portraying Truman as a sharp politician playing the part of a bubbling hick, but someone himself who is also, like Oppie, filled with a weird narcissistic complex regarding the bomb, feeling Oppenheimer"";-1
Yeah that and the writers strike. I didnâ€™t like Oppenheimer that much and I love cillian Murphy and history. Encarto was good. Mario bros was pretty good. Last couple spidermen have been good. Looking forward to napoleon though.;-1
""The only good film of this year is without a doubt Oppenheimer. Thatâ€™s it."";1
""""""uhm ackshauly kitty oppenheimer sucked because she was like totally stereotypical and like not a strong character and like yeah she was actually a real person who was that kind of person but i don't like it and its not good because... it just isn't okay???!!!"""""";-1

""@MYANC has stripped itself naked and became the prostitute for the  WMC. All that is there is to please the apartheid beneficiaries like Herzov, Rupert,Oppenheimer and such. Mbalula is their ice boy and is good at his job. Remember he wants relayed a message from that thief to JZ"";-1
""Oppenheimer. Really good movie and didnâ€™t at all seem like three hours, which I guess is a definite âœ… for any film that long/10.  Not as funny as Barbie though, which was a shame. Needed a bit during the bomb testing when someone goes â€œI am become DEAF more like, RIGHT LADSâ€"";1
Holy shit it was absolutely amazing...  Shocking!!!  I cried like 6-8x and it was Oppenheimer good.  A Godzilla movie in all subtitles just rocked my world…;1
Itâ€™s hard to make a movie that is good? Is that what you meant to say. Like making dune or Oppenheimer is hard. But the flash. I doubt it.;-1
My mom recently said Oppenheimer was too long & loved this movie even though I told her it was longer. Then sheâ€™s like well this one was good & Oppenheimer was kinda boring. Lolol;-1
i dont even like his video format. he's actually pretty bad at presentation... even his good videos seem to be missing something.  and he got creepy since the covaids...  i'll check out Oppenheimer next time. I've heard of him and that he's good.;-1
Iâ€™ve been watching oppenheimerğŸ˜³. But also thereâ€™s good stuff in the theater this weekend like Boy and the Heron;-1
Lmao Iâ€™m not even a Nolan fan like that. I thought Oppenheimer was good but not this great masterpiece like ppl say. Itâ€™s just so funny how wrong you are. You say who says heâ€™s a sure bet while youâ€™re sure he wonâ€™t get nom. What will you say when youâ€™re proven wrong?;-1
Oppenheimer was good. MI7 was not good in comparison to other MI movies. It just stood out because it was in a sea of awful movies like Indian Jones.;-1
""I havenâ€™t seen Oppenheimer yet and I like Nolan but Iâ€™d probably rank 3 Tarantino movies before any of Nolanâ€™s.  Plus, superhero movies are a cheat code so as good as his Batmanâ€™s were itâ€™s not an original."";-1
""I saw May December. It deserves to win against Killers of the Flower Moon but still, I wish KotFM to win... And there are still competitors like Barbie and Oppenheimer(and I root for #Barbie for the record ğŸ˜‰ when it comes to those two) Good films this year, and tbh Idc who wins"";1
""Last summer I was chatting with a cashier about the movie """"Oppenheimer."""" I said something like, """"Of course we know how it ends, but they do a good job of building the suspense anyway.""""  She stared at me blankly. She didn't know who Oppenheimer was or how his story ended."";-1
As for outside Star Wars while there plenty with good character building like Andor I do generally enjoy stuff like Oppenheimer a hell of a lot more than whatever Star Wars or Marvel have been putting out lately;-1
#Oppenheimer a story worth telling..a movie worth watching..such good meaningful cinema...every dialogue leaves an impact..every minute feels well spent..every actor looks committed every expression like it's truly meant. do not miss!!;-1
""I think I figured out what the one thing that bugged me about the Trinity test in Oppenheimer was. It just looks like it's too close. You can see the effort they put in to make it look so good, but the perspective was off. It looks like it's a few hundred feet away..."";-1

Also a very good point! This year has been loaded. Definitely the most fun I've had at the theaters in awhile.   And yeah like don't get me wrong I'm not really here to trash oppenheimer. I did really like it and its one of my fav films of the year. But ever since KoTFM came out-;-1
""i like Oppenheimer a lot as well, but KOTFM blew me away. It was so so good"";1
""On a good day, you can imagine OPPENHEIMER as PARASITE - an urgent, immediate film that feels like it's tapped into this moment and it wins big. On a bad day, it can be 1917 - an incredible film nominated for all the right things, *even writing*, yet it only wins the tech awards."";-1
I feel like Oppenheimer over bringing these images to light but in a good way LMFAOOO;1
""They aren't dying. It's just too much of it.   The other films don't draw as much to balance things out. Oppenheimer, Barbie and KOTFM are proof that good films will draw! Not the woke and forced sh*t like what Disney are doing."";-1
""I still haven't seen C'mon C'mon yet smh. 2021 is right there with it for me. I had two 5's and the rest are close, but none of these are as good as Oppenheimer and I also like May December and KOTFM better than anything outside of the top 2 that year"";-1
""I guess a vain attempt to seem smart. I love how conservatives like HvB can look at a film like Oppenheimer and walk away thinking â€œYeah, weâ€™re the good guys.â€"";-1
""Nolan could've put a turd on the screen for 2.5 hours and people would be talking about how great and magnificent it is. And Oppenheimer was good, it just wasn't a masterpiece like so many seem to say. I think his dark Knight movies were all better."";1
""Ok, this is very good filmmaking, even actingâ€” some of the best depictions of Oppenheimer & Groves here. The pacing, cadence, soundtrackâ€¦ all excellent.  But like p much all of this movie, itâ€™s so weird to me that this is whatâ€™s highlighted as compelling for this subject matter."";-1
Fax. After all the promotion and all the memes I expected the Oppenheimer bomb to be like the one from minus oneğŸ˜‚ good movie but major let down. Now with Godzilla minus one I did not expect his atomic breath to be an atomic bombğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ’¥ I expected a classic Godzilla blast;-1
""I'm looking forward to Dune, the first was an excellent movie. But most are trash, especially the superhero movies and the last 4 SW-films. This year I've only seen Oppenheimer in the cinema and it was good. but films like LOTR-trilogies aren't made anymore unfortunally."";-1
A movie person grabs the hot tamales and a good medium popcorn and lays in.  We like what we like.  Btw as that person I actually liked Oppenheimer this year.;1
Itâ€™s been 1 of the worst years for trailers ever. Even good movies like Dungeons & Dragons had bad trailers outside of Barbie & Oppenheimer. What happened? Itâ€™s coincidence that the only hit superhero movie was GOTG 3 was the one with a decent trailer. All the others were dire;-1
""But like the story is so good, and i kinda wanna write it and then take it to a studio. Not to give too much away, but think:  Oppenheimer X Hereditary X Everything Everywhere All At Once"";-1

""We need more RAW Behind the scenes of movies. Watched the oppenheimer one, and while it is good, it still feels like promotional material. Just give me hours of uncut material from on set and director/actor interaction like the old Fincher ones. Imagine just 12 hour B-Roll!!!"";-1
""I also find it cute when BS movies forward fake facts and myths, like insisting Einstein or Oppenheimer weren't good at Math, whereas the only way to truly understand quantum physics or gravity is through mathematical models."";-1
""Oppenheimer isn't great storytelling it's more like a documentary, people are hating animal due to misogyny apart from that everything was good considering Mass masala movie. It could have been shorter but still it wasn't bad as people are portraying. 90%  audience enjoyed animal"";-1
""I know in recent movies like Tenet that was an actual problem, but in this movie it's on purpose. The scene where they were all arguing over the use of the bomb? And it flashes white? The score in any good movie tells us what's going on too;-1";" and it's telling us that Oppenheimer"
""I like it, too. But I can't stress enough about how Oppenheimer is just miles better than anything this year in film. I think Minus One is good aside from the typical ok CGI from Japan, but the writing just doesn't hold up to what Oppenheimer offers, not even the acting."";-1
""like for a dt on an oppenheimer edit  (ps Iâ€™m not good at making edits, Iâ€™m bored)"";-1
Lot to like about Godzilla. Mainly the very effective ability to convey the collective PTSD the Japanese people went through post World War II. About as good as you can get when it comes to monster movies. Weirdly good companion piece to an Oppenheimer year.;-1
I think too many movies nowadays lack memorable soundtracks but like certain recent movies actually have some good ass scores  Minus One and Oppenheimer are the first to come to mind;-1
like i thought oppenheimer was mid at best but apparently itâ€™s crazy good? İdk;1
""Meanwhile Lord of the Rings films were 178/179/201 minutes, Endgame was 181 minutes, Oppenheimer 181 minutesâ€¦people will sit thru a good film like itâ€™s nothing."";1
""I have ruminated on this and I think I've settled on the opinion that Oppenheimer would be a solid, good Best Picture winner if it's indeed headed on that path. Wouldn't be my personal #1 but I like it a lot and it's better than some other films in consideration."";-1
""ugg.  hate the movie oppenheimer.  trying to make the most evil men look like poor innocent victims.  just more warmongering propaganda trying to disguise itself as superficial shitlib concern.  say the right things, do the opposite.  pretend you are the good guy, but do evil."";0

""I watched Oppenheimer and it's a good film. However, I still like 'Fat Man And Little Boy' just a smidge more.   If you put Cillian Murphy in 'Fat Man And Little Boy', extend the film to include the drama of losing his security clearance and you have the perfect film."";1
I agree. Both were good but not great.  IDK why Oppenheimer was films in I-max (itâ€™s essentially a bio pic) That technology would have been better suited to a movie like Inception.;-1
Oppenheimer.   It is as good as everyone says it is. But maybe don't watch it if you like to be uplifted in any way.;1
this will give me a mental breakdown because if killers doesnt win i will fall apart but i will be extremely devastated if it does not go to past lives like i might have to be committed but then oppenheimer was soooo good but if that lady and her man win i will burn it all down;-1
Sorry Iâ€™m just a sucker for succession like that show is just very very goodâ€¦. In terms of films. Oppenheimer was chefâ€™s kissâ€¦ there are some other films I still want to watch like Maestro so maybe this week;1
Barbie and Oppenheimer are the most obvious picks here  The others did make money but barbenheimer is gonna be one of those moments in film history thatâ€™ll never be forgotten like the hype was INSANE  Mario did good too but it was an illumination film based on a famous ip;-1
""#Barbie was garbage. Just like the majority of the movies made in Hollywood. Hollywood rarely makes anything good these days.   Barbie leads Golden Globe nominations with 9, followed closely by 'Oppenheimer' (from @AP) https://apnews.com/article/5c9e65ca2c6159b73d69d455b1d0c951"";-1

""Finally saw Oppenheimer in the theater. It was real good, but I feel like IMAX was kind of a waste :/  Also I would have enjoyed more nuclear explosion footage :)"";1
Damn i really did just spend the last 3 hours watching Oppenheimer on my phone via Twitter just like Christopher Nolan intended. And it was a good ass movie;1
""I like the Oppenheimer scene more, but this scene was good to compare."";1
Sometimes movies are best seen in theaters which means you gotta wait to get a good seat. Like with Oppenheimer 70mm;1
""I agree, good movie, but not to where I would want to immediately watch it again, like I did with Oppenheimer. Another lengthy movie!"";1
Oppenheimer is actually looking like a good movie so far;1
""Oopenheimer is an extraordinary cinematic achievement. Like he has always done, Nolan pushes the boundaries of filmmaking.   The evolution in biographies from Good Will Hunting to Beautiful Mind and then the leap to Oppenheimer is remarkable."";-1
""Oppenheimer to me just feels like Nolanâ€™s best work of art. Like I Struggle to find flaws in this movie, itâ€™s just so perfectly executed in practically every way possible. Just complete utter awe watching this scene for the first time, so Good but Horrifying at the same time"";-1

Itâ€™s good but not like the best movie this year tho. Oppenheimer and Across the Spider Verse clears imho.;1
Holy shit Oppenheimer in 4k looks so fucking good.  Like it's so crisp;1
""For the record, these are my feelings on Oppenheimner  Me: did you see Flower Moon?  Co-worker: nah  Me: it's good  Co-worker: is it """"good"""" like Oppenheimer?  Me: Man, fuck Oppenheimer!!"";-1

like yeah barbie didnt have as good as effects as oppenheimer but its still good lmao;-1
""Sounds somewhat Oppenheimer influenced.  Like a lot of Biopics and historical dramas, I'm not holding my breath that it'll be great, but one can always hope. The typical movie like this is pretty weak, but when they're good they're great."";-1
EXCUSE ME??????  Like both had awesome non-CGI effects BUT OPPENHEIMERâ€™S WERE SO GOOD?? WHATğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­;-1
There is honestly not a single argument for Oppenheimer to win best VFX over something like The Creator. Not a single argument. Believe it or not Oppenheimer isnâ€™t the only movie with good vfx this year.;-1
Normally stories have a theme that relates to the main character and their transformation through the movie this can be good or bad.  I've honestly never heard someone say this considering that movies like Joker or Oppenheimer end in a sad message and they are universally praised;-1
Oh man this looks really good I wonder if I can get the wife to watch it with me.  I have to say she really like Oppenheimer which was surprising as she is not big on historical feature movies. But this one kept you involved.   This looks fricken Hilarious!;-1
""Wut? Indians do not even care about the whole """"Marvels"""" characters. Hate is a complicated world.  We like stuff like No Way Home and Oppenheimer precisely because it's good cinema.  We will like Furiosa too. LOL"";-1

Take out antman for Oppenheimer and probably the marvels the vfx was pretty good and I did like it but there was like a 1-3 weird shots that didnâ€™t look finished still very hood vfx overall especially the final part with the closing the other universe that vfx was crazy good;-1
""I think this might be my favorite film of the year now. Oppenheimer was really good but itâ€™s got a whole big existentialist thing going on and thatâ€™s hard to think about at times."";1
Oppenheimer visuals are like wallpapers imo. Just a bunch of random images that are not exactly part of the story and one big explosion at the end. I still think it should be nominated because its good.;1
guys oppenheimer is so goodâ€¦ like itâ€™s sooooo fucking good and gets better every time;1
oppenheimer was good but the jfk name drop like he was fuckin iron man or smth in the mcu tainted the entire thing for me.;-1
""They usually reserve categories like this as sorta """"consolation prizes"""" for films that were pretty good, but not the typical Oscar bait. So you see more genre films, while the big dramas like Oppenheimer get the awards the acedemy things matter more."";-1
Yaw didnâ€™t like Oppenheimerâ€¦? I thought that shit was good as hell.;1
""It's like when you go to a good movie.  You might tweet: wow, I really thought Oppenheimer was great. Check it out!"";1
Nominating Oppenheimer for best VFX would be like making a basketball player MVP of the league for having one pretty good game ğŸ’€;-1
""Alright, Iâ€™m calling it. Good game we are done. Bro science >real science because muscles. Oppenheimer would like to talk to you for a second"";-1
I'm still not over Oppenheimer's last like 20 minutes. That climax and then the last conversation was crazy good;1
""Unpopular opinion(?): Oppenheimer doesn't deserve a VFX award. Excellent movie, but its practical effects failed to capture the magnitude of the real Trinity detonation. Would have preferred if Christopher Nolan opted for (good) CGI like the black hole in Interstellar."";-1
""The creator, GODZILLA and ATSV are the only films deserving of being here... GOTG was good but like nothing compared to those 3... How Oppenheimer isn't here is an actual fucking robbery"";-1
""But itâ€™s the point that the VFX work while good in Oppenheimer, was not as demanding and overall impressive compared to anything else on this list. Like Indy wonâ€™t be nominated in the end, but itâ€™s 20 minutes of de-aging ford is more impressive than anything in Oppenheimer"";-1
This was a good movie year for old Presidents looking like dickheads. Harry Truman in Oppenheimer. Calvin Coolidge in Killers of the Flower Moon. They never cared about humanity. All of them.;-1
Yes I still rent movies. Yes I use Redbox. They've been generally pretty good on new releases except for Oppenheimer. They are pretending this movie doesn't exist for some reason. Really stupid on their part because I think a lot of people would like to rent it!;-1
""Much like SPENCER (though not to that extent) the OPPENHEIMER screenplay reads like a long poem, and as someone who has struggled with Nolan screenplays in the past, I'm just floored. It's just so good"";-1
Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day sounds like a good time to watch Oppenheimer for the first time.   How it started             How it ended;-1
Lol. This loser gave a negative review to Oppenheimer but thinks this shithole adaptation of archies is perfect. Indian critics are just like indian filmmakers and audiences- no good taste.;-1
""I think Gen Z just donâ€™t really know what a good movie looks like.  The dialogue was just poor - the script was really lacklustre. And a dull, plodding third act."";0
i cant really compare the two like idkâ€¦ like my favorite of the two is probably oppenheimer but i cant say â€œoppenheimer is better than barbie because ..â€ bc theyre so completely different and good in their own ways;-1
""I am being so annoying about this movie, but like, itâ€™s that good. It really shows how you can in fact make a â€œhistoricalâ€ movie and not be conceded with minute by minute historical accuracy. Oppenheimer is one of my top movies of the yearâ€¦but Godzilla actually"";1
""Is it just me or am I seeing Barbie revisionism? Like, câ€™mon guys, it was still a pretty good movie even if it wasnâ€™t on Oppenheimerâ€™s level."";-1
""Oppenheimer was just pretty good, I'm not gonna act like it's a masterpiece when there are dozens of better films from this year"";1
""like even if i think nolan is generally a good director, iâ€™m never gonna be as impressed with oppenheimer as iâ€™m going to be with inception or the dark knight, because they feel a lot more interesting and challenging to make good from a writing perspective"";-1
Making fun of someoneâ€™s taste in cinema and then putting up titles like Avatar and Evil Dead is not the serve you think it is ğŸ’€ i think if one of your factors for enjoying a movie is â€œhow good the gore wasâ€ then Oppenheimer was never going to be your slice of cake;-1
both good but barbie was better and way more entertaining- christopher nolan is very one note and it showed in oppenheimer (like it does in all of his movies but i digress);-1
One warning i forgot for the Oppenheimer review. If you have a surround with a good sub it will scare the hell out of you. Flash back scenes come and go fast and they bring HUGE room shaking bass like a damn jump scare in a horror movie. They mixed the bass for damage!;-1
Just finished watching Oppenheimer And i hate to say it but I will still say it's definitely 10 times better than Barbie movieğŸ’€ Only downside in this movie are the sex scenes like who tf thought it would be a good idea to put those scenes in a history related movieğŸ«  Anyway10/10;1
""#NowWatching Oppenheimer for the second time, I feel like I have missed many details from the first time! Nolan is simply a genius! He cares about every little detail in his movies. And the man who plays Einstein is really good, I wish he had more time on screen! 9/10"";1
""Killers of the Flower Moon is good.   I didn't like how the ending was narrated tho, with Scorsese telling the final story. It'sa little cringe.   I guess I had high expectations, thinking it might be the movie to rival Oppenheimer for Oscars BP. It's not  We wait for Poor Things"";-1
""Hey donâ€™t do Oppenheimer dirty like that, it was pretty good imo"";1
Another distinction that people fail to make is between largely political works of art and largely partisan works of art.   Something like Dune is a deeply political work of art but not a particularly partisan one. Oppenheimer is another good example of this.;-1
RIGHT. like barbie was good but it wasnâ€™t phenomenal. oppenheimer on the other hand;-1
""while i agree, respectfully, i dont agree 'that much' bc i didnt even find oppenheimer good, im sorry... ik it's critically acclaimed but it just didnt do it for me (bias aside). even the performances. I think i even like interstellar better, if i had to rank nolan films"";-1
""Slim category, and in all fairness he did a good job even if I didnâ€™t like Oppenheimer as a person"";-1
""ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€ this is good  Margot Robbie says a producer for â€˜OPPENHEIMERâ€™ told her they should move the â€˜BARBIEâ€™ release date  â€œI was like, â€˜Weâ€™re not moving our date.

oppenheimer would be a movie that is universally enjoyed by a very wide audience, oppenheimer is just for people who like history and bombs pretty much, the visuals were good i'll say that but as an outsider who doesnt rly care, i didnt rly enjoy it and found it boring"";0
""yeah i mean i never was a big margot fan but i like the way she handled this situation...i mean oppenheimer is obviously one of the best movies and i'm not comparing them but still it felt good to have a female led, directed movie as the no. 1 movie of the year..."";-1
UGHHHH i never watch these but this is so good like the whole process is just fascinating to me and particularly these films and how much they evoke all the best parts of cinema like the built sets and practical elements of barbie and then the sound and camerawork in oppenheimer;-1
""Barbie, Oppenheimer, Five Nights at Freddy's, Godzilla Minus One, and then you throw in Super Mario Bros. People are going to the theaters, just not for woke garbage like this. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 made money, but that was a good movie."";-1
""Like Iâ€™m so tired of seeing praise for this man. Like his performance in Oppenheimer wasnâ€™t even that good, he was playing the same prideful character he always does"";-1
""This is the kind of thing that only sounds good when said to like Kevin feige, Oppenheimer was not a guaranteed success? Also feels like if marvel movies lasted any longer we'd have had them do this exact thing lol"";-1
""Stop acting like Oppenheimer was good it was substantially about administrative procedure law, and security clearance paperwork."";0
Itâ€™s like Oppenheimerâ€™s having that final conversation with Einsteinâ€¦ donâ€™t mess it up like good luck omg;-1
""Like whether or not you think Oppenheimer etc are good films itâ€™s the same shit in a different order on every list, useful at most for people who didnâ€™t follow film and want to catch up, boring for anyone who did"";-1
i finally watched it and hated it. oppenheimer being the most pro peace anti bomb character in the film is a fucking joke. hes the good guy cause he cried and felt bad about it? boo hoo  also as a movie it was forgettable. every famous actor looking exactly like themselves again;-1
""So Oppenheimer was good but overly long at 3 hours & the last hour was a bunch of red scare crap, accusing the guy who ended WWII of being disloyal to America was insane and I think the reason they did not show the dropping of the Atom Bomb was so we would not look like monsters."";-1
""omg I was the same!!! ğŸ˜‚ I tried it like 2 or 3 times and couldnâ€™t get past the first 15mins but after Oppenheimer, I was like ok letâ€™s trust the process since theyâ€™re both Nolan movies ğŸ˜‚ itâ€™s soooo good Dubz, try it again ok! haha"";-1
""Feel like you glossed over The Holdovers which I think has a decent shot at winning, it's a good blend of tackling deep content material whilst also being a warming holiday movie. (I still have it 2nd only behind Oppenheimer)"";-1
First of all brother Sam Bahadur isn't Oppenheimer. I haven't seen the film yet but it's just a good movie. It's no masterpiece or something like that. And Oppenheimer did great business because it has the buzz. It was a Nolan movie.;-1
""My problem with it is that it spends more time critiquing what wasnâ€™t in the movie than what was. Thatâ€™s not a critique, itâ€™s like if I said Barbie wasnâ€™t good because there were no explosions, it wasnâ€™t set in 1942 and wasnâ€™t Oppenheimer. Like, okay? And???"";-1
""Were any of these as good as Strauss in Oppenheimer? Probably not, but pretending like they are so so far below it is dismissive and straight up wrong."";-1
Bro fan war aside Salar is totally different type movie from Dunki . Just like Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both audience will also be different. Why so much hate ?? Dunki trailer is good and it's Rajkumar Hirani movie he can't show much in trailer iykyk;-1
i am rallying behind oppenheimer to sweep like that was Real Cinema ğŸ˜¹ if you think barbie is no.1 movie of the year please watch more movies i beg it is a GOOD MOVIE it is a great movie even but its not oscar sweep worthy be serious;-1
""Oppenheimer was â€˜goodâ€™ not â€˜that goodâ€™â€¦â€¦. *the bomb testing scene was mid at best, ko layinmu that explosion wont incinerateâ€¦â€¦â€¦and top it all off, I thought he was some badass, but instead he came back crying like a baby just like how truman summed it all upâ€¦.."";-1
I watched Oppenheimer. I actually want more. Like even an extended cut. It was so good;1
""Would be kind of weird if he did. Like what would be the aim of him saying that for his potential acceptance speech for Oppenheimer? But you know, knowing who RDJ is, heâ€™ll for sure say some good and funny quips."";-1
""Yeah, he acting was good ğŸ¦œğŸ¦œ the soundtrack was too good tho almost like ludwing's score in Oppenheimer  The ending felt lacking tho ğŸ˜…"";-1
Blunt was good in Oppenheimer sure but her character wasnâ€™t written the best and sheâ€™s not really on the same level as someone like Randolph or Moore imo;-1
""Well yea Memento isnâ€™t that good, neither is Insomnia. But to call Oppenheimer boring of all criticisms is like insane. And as a film student to say it isnâ€™t your kind of movie is type crazy"";-1
Currently enjoying Oppenheimer.   Good movie for a cold morning like this one. There's already frost on the ground.;1
""I always thought it was a poor myself especially Keanu's accent. Oldman is good but he is always good though he does say what sounds like """" I am the last of the Formica at one point"""" Oppenheimer is great cinema but not Nolan's best which is Interstellar"";1
I have finally watched Oppenheimer and Barbie this week. Oh. And like 7 hours of wrestling. Oh. And the Detroit Lions. I love good things. Good things make me happy.;-1
I'd be good for any of these 3 films getting all the Awards their all Great I don't know if I can really say which one i like more to be honest Across the Spider-verse is definitely my favorite animated film of all time and then Oppenheimer and Minus one both have the Live action;-1
""Theyâ€™re in other nolan films. Robert Downey jr and Matt Damon are not. I feel like thatâ€™s a pretty good chunk right there, but I could be wrong. Bohemian rhapsody is the second highest grossing biopic after Oppenheimer, and American sniper famously was a huge smash as well."";-1
""Everyone should have a stepdad's perception of movies. If you like it, it's good! Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Oppenheimer, Togo, Pacific Rim, & Southern Country Christmas can all be the same type of movie--a good one"";-1
""People are paying 90-130+$ for a steel book, @bestbuy. Couldâ€™ve sold in store and make good money back, sad day when the biggest movies from summer got no steel book or limited to like 100,000 smhâ€¦ please someone save the day and release a proper physical Oppenheimer"";-1
""Wait is this a safe space to say I didnâ€™t think he was that good In Oppenheimer and I definitely didnâ€™t think he was like, vastly different from his normal persona in it?"";-1
""Looking back on it, I don't think the nude Oppenheimer was unnecessary. It was awkward and that's what we are. Human. It showed Oppenheimer what he was. A man. A person like you or I. It humanizes him and puts his legacy alongside his body. I think it was a good addition."";-1
""Barbie is a movie ? Lol it was just a pu*sy fantasy ğŸ˜‚. Nonsense type of movie no one gives a f. Those who like movie went for Oppenheimer, the real movie with real and good script"";-1
""He isn't wrong: Oppenheimer's regret has a good element of self-aggrandizing performance, he could've chosen not to be the one to build the bomb and he always knew what the consequences of his creation would be, here Truman just exposes him like """"you're one of us, don't act holy"";-1
""Between this and Oppenheimer being so popular I really think this year is showing that young people like good, serious, well made movies in a way people have assumed they wouldnâ€™t"";-1
Oppenhiemer was an awsome movie. i didn't think id like it but  it was beautiful to watch. the director did a good job.  I recommend it. I bought the Blu ray DVD the other day. I also have the Barbie movie so I have both Barbinheimer.    #Oppenheimer;1
""Finally saw Oppenheimer, and it was better than I ever thought it would be. Really doesnâ€™t feel like 3 hours, itâ€™s just that good."";1
People used the same language to talk about Oppenheimer but I donâ€™t see the same reactions to that as I do here so whatâ€™s ur point ? Theyâ€™re literally just talking about how good a performance is but using more extravagant language itâ€™s not like their saying they condone it.;-1
Meg Ryan was a legit A-lister back in the day.  The only thing I've seen her son in is The Boys.   And literally like 3 seconds of Oppenheimer.  Never really stood out to me as very good or very bad.;-1
""I mean films like Oppenheimer, that are so well written and acted."";1
""somehow oppenheimer was purchased on my apple tv, i feel forced to watch like not a good force"";-1
""GOOD MORNING TO ALL!   Championship weekend resumes today and your #Plug is on his Oppenheimer, cooking up bombs.   Like, comment and subscribe if you want your #Plugs â“‚ï¸ğŸ¬ğŸ³  LINK IN BIO"";-1
 Oppenheimer was a different level.   If you havenâ€™t watched in theatre you have no idea what it would be like.   You missed a good one aman.;1
The last movie I watched in theatre was OMG2 and Oppenheimer. Prior to that it was pre pandemic.   Somehow it doesnâ€™t feel like any good movies are coming. It is either some movie from Hollywood where one American city is being destroyed or some nonsense stuff from Bollywood;-1
""Big Oppie guy here, which I hate to say because Iâ€™ve hated Nolan in the past. However, I didnâ€™t feel like RDJâ€™s performance was particularly that stunning. Heâ€™s good, and I like his acting, but thereâ€™s more deserving out there even in OPPENHEIMER alone"";-1
""Barbie and Oppenheimer were both good. Scorceseâ€™s Killers was very long but good too. Good movies are still being made, the difference is ppl donâ€™t care about movies like they used to. Instead ppl watch Americas Funniest Home Videos in an endless scroll."";1
I thought the makeup job in Oppenheimer was really good but seeing these ads for his Apple show I guess Oldman kinda just looks like that now;-1
""Oppenheimer. For me Nolun's finest work, for me its the most composed as a filmmaker he's been so far. Drama in this is by far the most perfected in any of his films. The way it picks up slowly and lifts is so so good. Looks like a million bucks, in noir especially.-"";-1
""Coppola is boring except for The Conversation. Oppenheimer was surprisingly good. I try to avoid American cinema as much as I can. Occasionally, I make the mistake of giving a director another chance, like with Haynes in Cannes. It won't happen again."";-1
""Yeah probably a good idea, I got there like an hour and a half before Oppenheimer and there were like 60 ppl in line lol"";-1
I had a good laugh when they name dropped â€œKennedyâ€ in Oppenheimer like it was a post credit scene teasing a sequel ğŸ˜‚;-1
""I dont thinks this is a good poster honestly, looks like Oppenheimer"";-1
#Animal #AnimalMovie #RanbirKapoorğ“ƒµ  Intermission : what a movie Animal is great but action imagination is good on paper but lacks little bit but animal first half have gapes & rushed little bit Overall must watch 1st half  & last it's like Oppenheimer;-1

""In contrast (pun intended), Minus One is all brightly lit. And donâ€™t you worry, if you only came for the destruction, youâ€™re still eating good on this film. Like a fateful meeting between Oppenheimer and Bruckheimer, atomic explosions shower slow motion particle debris fields."";-1
""Barbie is up there with The Truman Show and The Matrix. Oppenheimer is just another boring biopic, like Napoleon. The only good historical film that came out this year was Killers of the Flower Moon."";-1
""Seems like reviewers have been working hard to give good reviews since Oppenheimer left theatres. Filmspotting, MAM and The Big Picture. One can hear them working up a sweat trying to make bad films seem worthwhile. It's disappointing actually."";0
""Barbie, Oppenheimer, and disappointing MCU movies have taught us that people like GOOD movies.   Why donâ€™t we just start making good movies and not bad movies?"";-1
""I dunno, I think it's because this movie looks like absolute trash and Barbie and Oppenheimer looked good. """"original"""" is necessary but not sufficient"";-1
""They do cuz Barbie and Oppenheimer had great sales. People are tired of marvel putting out so much content, even if it is good. They got like a new title on streaming or in theatres every month. Itâ€™s too much"";-1
my hot take is that as good as rdj is in oppenheimer he'd be like my fourth pick for supporting actor from the movie;-1
""as a cillian murphy fan and an oppenheimer fan, this movie was bad and the cinematography was WAY done up and overly dramatic. i felt like the movie was playing in fast forward the whole time while trying to electrocute me. i was also on mushrooms, but this shit wasn't good."";-1

I still think his performance in GOOD TIME is incredibly offensive but Iâ€™ve like him in most things. Phenomenal in LICORICE PIZZA and those of you who think heâ€™s bad in OPPENHEIMERâ€¦need to hear clips of what the real Edward Teller sounded like;-1
Oppenheimer is like crazy good and I can't stop thinking about it since I saw it. Just an incredible piece of filmmaking. Awe inspiring in the truest sense and utterly haunting.;1
They're trying to Oppenheimer him. Good thing we just had a movie that shows what this looks like.;-1
""Past Lives is a good movie but #1 is pretty strong, and Oppenheimer outside the top 10 kind of feels like being try-hard contrarian"";-1
I felt the thing for Oppenheimer. Cillian is good subtle performance but his performance like Colin Farrell last year. I think the editing was a problem for the actors' performances. It was good in terms of story sequencing but the downside was that I didn't relate to the actors.;-1
""I was trolling a bit but itâ€™s wild you donâ€™t think he has 1 good film like Memento is pretty undeniable to me so are Oppenheimer, Interstellar, Dunkirk, The prestige etc"";-1
""Also to due note, News of the end of 2023 is many places like Best Buy are ending Physical DVD Media.  So good on #Oppenheimer but it might have been easier to sell out then when #Barbie came out earlier, just a thought.ğŸ§ğŸ§"";-1

genuinely cannot comprehend how someone could hypothetically like oppenheimer this much like itâ€™s *good* at best get real;-1
""I dislike Oppenheimer and disagree with this criticism. The critique I gave of it was """"I don't think this is a good use of Nolan's penchant for non-linear storytelling (as in, it I think it should be more straightforward) and I don't like the propagindistic, individual focus on how one man feels about nuking Japanese people."""""";-1
Do you know how good Oppenheimer has to be to get a good amount of film Twitter to agree itâ€™s one of the best movies ever made like thats history;1
""Oppenheimer was a good example of something to go see in theaters.  Nolan is one of those directors who shoots in formats like Imax for a reason, and it's hard to recreate that at home. Otherwise 99% of the time a nice home setup is less $ and much less frustrating than going out"";1
I've not heard very much good either.  But people were raving about Oppenheimer and I didn't like it very much.  Maybe the key with historical stories is to go against the grain.;0
""Watched Oppenheimer, and while it """"looks"""" like a good film, it in fact, kinda isn't. It's slow and it's pretty boring sometimes. It's is also 2 films stuck together. The first is ok.   Disappointed, as I'm interested in the history. This was a flat film. 6/10"";0
""Oppenheimer was meh, Barbie is propaganda, MIP 6 is like the last 5, Elemental only did good in South Korea. I could keep going"";0
I finally saw Oppenheimer tonight (definitely felt like a Best Picture to me).  It made me think that as corny as it sounds all these grand struggles really do come down to Good vs Evil.  Fortunately Good makes more Sense than Evil so we know which side the smart folks pick :^).;-1
""While Iâ€™m inclined to agree that the well is poisoned this doesnâ€™t really account for the fact this year still had plenty of box office hits such as Barbie, Mario and Oppenheimer (even superhero stuff like Spider-Man and Guardians 3 made good money)"";-1
Amy adam is an Incredible actress and she was good in the DCEU. Ofc her best work came in movies outside of the superhero genre like it almost alwys does for other actors. Even RDJ is on record saying that he was afraid he lost some of his acting ability coming into Oppenheimer.;-1
""this year had so many films people were looking forward to like barbie, oppenheimer, spiderverse 2, Saw X, the fucking mario movie, FNAF, hunger games,  going to the movies is expensive as hell yall. with this many good films ppl are gonna be Picky babeyyy"";-1
who said oppenheimer was edited like a tiktok. like it's really not and that's dumb as a criticism... but it kind of is but in a good and beautiful way;-1
understand the plot  - Barbie is a really good movie  - Barbie was a part of a meme with Oppenheimer which undoubtedly increased profits for both movies  I could go on but i dont feel like it;-1
just watched oppenheimer again with the whole fam. still good.;1
""Ok, aside from that, what is wrong Cillian Murphy, he's had great antagonistic performances, like Oppenheimer (I don't care if he had good attentions he clearly had some antagonist ways both in this movie and in real life)"";-1
It took me two days to watch Oppenheimer .. it was good though but I felt like I was taking a class ğŸ¤£;1
""these posts make me feel like I'm going insane, people complaining about the one brief, sex scene in Oppenheimer. caddyshack had more nude scenes. watch any movie more than 25 years old. there should be more sex because it is good and cool, and movies don't have to be for babies."";-1
""Like Zack Snyder Justice league, Avatar TWOW, Oppenheimer Theyâ€™re good. But lowkey.. wished it was shorter.. Reservior Dogs, Batman begins (or TDK), even Star Wars Rogue One. Amazing movies for its length.."";-1
Excellent question. What is left to talk about? Comics and movies made off them suck. Dramas suck. Historical novels and movies like Oppenheimer and Napolean are good and might be considered one venue worthy after analysis. Comedy? More woke B.S.. WHAT IS LEFT?;-1

""Had no clue the mental images oppenheimer sees are done practically, that bit near the end looked like really good cgi in the film"";-1
""The main reason that Oppenheimer justifies its runtime better than a lot of longer movies like it is because it's 100% backloaded. The point where, in other movies, you'd start checking your watch is the point Oppenheimer actually starts getting good"";-1

Oppenheimer for Cinematography just feels like a done deal. It has good competition but I donâ€™t see anything really toppling it.;-1
oppenheimer is kinda tied with spider-verse tbh. sorry but i still like my superhero slop when it's good;-1
""Oppenheimer was very good, but not great. I'd say 8.5. Miserable use of very bad and loud music in dialogue dense scenes that should have zero background track. Feels like two smaller and better movies mashed together. Script issues. Not top Nolan"";1
""Yeah, letâ€™s ignore movies like Oppenheimer and Barbie and top gun maverick and that Disney can no longer allow itself to make a good movie that anyone wants to see."";-1
""Yeah, I compared the battles to how Oppenheimer had these imagery of atoms that very much felt like â€people are here partly for cool visuals so lets show some off!â€. But for good and bad theyre 20 minute Action scenes rather than just some visual flavor?"";-1
""Damn. â€œOppenheimerâ€ was as good as folks said.   If you want a story about the bomb thatâ€™s  this book is a GREAT companion. Primary source based history, but written like a fictional narrative.   Shockwave: Countdown to Hiroshima https://a.co/d/eirFO1P"";1
Think of Oppenheimer meets the good parts of Schindlers list meets the sixth sense......kinda like that;-1
Ok. It was 2012 but shot in Black & White.  Oppenheimer was good. Iâ€™m random with movie selection but hopefully youâ€™ll find one you like;1
The pacing and sequencing of Oppenheimer is horrendous. Stop acting like idiots like me know who any of these people are ğŸ˜‚. I am going to have to watch it 4 more times with the captions on to understand wtf is going on but I think it's probably good idk.;-1
""Yeah heâ€™s definitely an underrated composer compared to someone like Hans Zimmer. I hope the upcoming Netflix show has good music, but unfortunately I feel like so many modern films and shows push scoring to the side. Oppenheimer felt like an exception to that."";-1
""Watched Oppenheimer. Good movie, good acting.  but I'm glad I didn't watch it in IMAX or not in normal Cinama hall.  This is made for watching on TV or laptop. 80% of the movie is just discussion scenes, and people are just talking and talking. Nothing like Nolan's grand movies."";1
Robert Oppenheimer is not a good person and I don't like him;-1
it does look good but idk KotFM and Oppenheimer are like generational work. whenever i see a list that doesn't have those two at the top i get suspicious;-1
""when things that people like are successful, it may mean there will be more things that they like. for instance, oppenheimer is a long-ass biopic directed by an auteur, so its huge dollars at the box office is (hopefully) good for the future of movies by big-name directors"";-1
Bro I donâ€™t have any personal vengeance with the theater infact I was happy that a theater like this is coming like this to my city! If you find it good enjoy that post positive comments! Do not sneek on peopleâ€™s opinion. I saw Oppenheimer there and it was fine for me!;-1
Must be weird for Casey Affleck to be in OPPENHEIMER where the point is: even people who hate you will be like â€œgood casting.â€;-1
oppenheimer wasnâ€™t even that good;0
""After being attached to cod for hours, itâ€™s so good to sit down and watch an incredible film like Oppenheimer. movies are my favorite"";1
""I feel like Oppenheimer is a real good family get together background movie, but moreso if you've seen it"";1
""I heard it was good, but had pacing issues... like, it's a 4.5 hour film that got trimmed down, and the missing film is noticeable.  I'll still watch at some point.  I still need to watch Oppenheimer"";-1
""I guess selling """"Pondus Imperii"""" yesterday is a good enough reason to watch the film this weekend. Hope is not like Oppenheimer and I'm fine. Don't have time for Hallmark blockbusters ğŸ‘¿ğŸ¤ª  BTW: This is my first Stable Video Diffusion micro vid."";-1
""Hmmm guys. Maybe the type of genre you like didn't have good movies 1. Grand Turismo  2. Oppenheimer (you need to concentrate and it's long but it's a good one) 3. Mission Impossible 7 (well it's Tom Cruise, it's you love him or hate him, but the movie is good) 4. The Covenant"";-1
""it was good, but I wouldnâ€™t say it was on another level, oppenheimerâ€™s trailer succeeded because they showed such a huge scale for the story, trailers for movies like kotfm can be great, but the scale of it all is on a lower levelâ€¦"";1
The acting in Oppenheimer was so good. The technical aspects of the film were brilliant. It better win for Best Sound.  But I think that script really needed some work. It was like Nolan tried to write two different movies and pushed them both together;1
""Oppenheimer was good, if you like science and politics and maybe WW2 history. Great performances, but too long for me. Also, I'm not sure I've ever heard the word """"communism/communist"""" spoken more time-densely than in any of my time consuming leftwing media in 2020's America."";1
""parents told me to come watch oppenheimer in it mom: â€œthereâ€™s sex scenesâ€ dad: â€œyea, like two seconds of it and wasnâ€™t even that goodâ€"";-1
Oppenheimer was really good. Kinda darkâ€¦like life.;1
Good song but it's like comparing Barbie with Oppenheimer;-1
""Hilarious, need more commentary like this.  Good job btw in Oppenheimer. The movie is awesome"";1
Oppenheimer and good food seems like a great Thanksgiving plan;1
""Damn RIP Scream 7, actually wanted a sequel to Scream 6, Shame studios always gotta muck it up. Personal Political views should be left out of an entertainment, But Political stories are good man I love stuff like Oppenheimer or Crime movies, OK well there should be a balance"";-1
""Yeah I def remember that, but I feel like there was still a good window to do something in August-September  It was honestly a miracle we got Oppenheimer for as long as we did considering The Marvels was supposed to come out on July 28"";-1
""from may to august i watched gotg3, asteroid city, elemental, spider-verse, nimona, no hard feelings, barbie, past lives, oppenheimer, blue beetle and tmnt. this isn't counting movies that aren't as good that i also watched like indiana jones 5 ğŸ˜­ (i think that ones okay)"";-1
""ok so i finally watched oppenheimer, good movie. on a personal level tho the marvel ass cameo by gÃ¶del & the complete erasure of von neumann were disappointing. a movie about some of the greatest minds to exist & not one thought provoking thing was said after like min 30"";1
""Gonna skip it, like I did with Oppenheimer and Barbie. Enough good movies to last a lifetime, no need for hyped-up midness"";-1
""Iâ€™d rather he do small movies like Memento that are actually good over soulless, bombastic trash like Oppenheimer"";0
""Finally watched Oppenheimer. Man, imagine the rollout of a weapon like the atomic bomb during a global geopolitical meltdown where different groups just want each other dead. Bioweapons? Forget about it. Good thing we live in such stable times."";-1
(watching the can you hear the music scene in oppenheimer) this is just like getting good at video games;-1
Critics are also cinema snobs. They will trash actual great movies like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and praise not so good movies like Oppenheimer. They dismiss animation as being for kids and that video game movies are bad. Hence why Sony was able to easily bribe them.;-1
""I also said Oppenheimer. I do like watching documentaries. For me aside from the awkward intimacy they showed in the movie,  It came off to me as a documentary. Though a good one."";-1
""Pulled the craziest comeback on this deadline, first time I was actually stressed cuz of work. But felt like Oppenheimer when I finished. God is good."";-1
Watching Oppenheimer tonight solo b/c she doesnâ€™t like Christopher Nolan.   Thinking about live tweeting the whole 3 hours so prob a good time to unfollow/block me.;-1
""And I think itâ€™s really interesting how shows like Good Omens, Our Flag Means Death, Doctor Who and films like Barbie, Oppenheimer and FNAF have been hugely popular this year DUE TO FAN HYPE, not traditional media hype-"";-1
""What in the absolute fuck was so ambitious about Oppenheimer? Seriously, people hype it up so much when it's just another Biopic in the vein of shit like Imitation Game and A Beautiful Mind. Good movie, okay but ambitious? Nah."";-1
Oppenheimer is so fucking good dude movies are like the best thing ever;1
""Hollywood also saw the success of Oppenheimer and was like """"nah we're good on making movies for adults"""""";-1
Good for you bud. Digital sales like Iâ€™ve said 100 times arenâ€™t affected by that. Which is where the movie made a lot of moneyâ€¦ also historical drama do not make tons of money lol. Oppenheimer is the only example of a film making that much;-1
S/O to @BestBuy for purposely under producing popular steelbooks like #Oppenheimer allowing only a select few to order as many copies as they want to resell to fans who actually want the film for double the price.    Good riddance from the #PhysicalMedia game.;-1
""My best friend in the world just said â€œokay, who ever directed Oppenheimer is really good. Has he or she made other movies i might like?â€  Guysâ€¦ GUYS ğŸ˜«  Where should i start?"";-1
Chris Nolan Iâ€™m sorry I just bought Oppenheimer digitally but I saw it in IMAX like you and the good lord intended in July;-1
""That has the potential to be as good as the 'Oppenheimer was a pro-bomb movie' thread. Utterly deranged with very bizarre caveats, like we are all Bolsheviks, essentially."";-1
""But Scorsese took it way too far, he should have just made it into a documentary. And with Oppenheimer, the purpose was to analyze his character like with Lawrence of Arabia. I donâ€™t know if Napoleon is going to be good or not, Iâ€™m hearing some bad reviews."";-1
""I saw it in a theater and thought it was good. But I think the people that held off and are watching now on max, giving it some praise, will tell you that they made the right call by saving their money for things like Barbie, Oppenheimer and MI7 which were all much better"";1
""Our economy is artificially propped up right now. People like Oppenheimer make a living by making people believe as long as they can, the economy is good. We are a nation of sheep."";-1
""You do know he wrote & produced Oppenheimer? The Dialogue was very good, you say he has weak areas, as if every other Producer is perfect. This film is his final masterpiece. Everything put together, just like Killers of the Flower Moon.   Also wrote The Batman Trilogy."";-1
Joker seems like a good call. Oppenheimer is too new to say.;-1
Ettingers useless followers made oppenheimer win. what good is 50k if you canâ€™t control them like a cult.;-1
""Itâ€™s mainly about streaming. Why watch a movie with bad reviews if itâ€™s going to be on Disney Plus or HBO Max in a couple of months? Movies with good reviews like â€˜Barbieâ€™, â€˜Oppenheimerâ€™, â€˜John Wick 4â€™, and â€˜The Equalizer 3â€™ did well at the box office."";-1
""I gotta. I havenâ€™t gotten into his filmography yet(that tracks, I guess), but I hadnâ€™t thought about how watching his stuff might help me understand other movies like Oppenheimer. Good idea!"";-1
""Actually, that's one of the biggest issues with Oppenheimer: it's heavily dialogue-driven, and the dialogue, when you can hear it, is abysmal. I'm not sure why a visual filmmaker like Nolan (who I like!) thought it was a good idea to do a movie that's mostly people talking."";-1
Has anyone considered that Barbie and Oppenheimer are just insanely good films Wyatt also happen to have subject matter with widespread appeal.   I really feel like thatâ€™s all it takes usually.;-1
If it's extremely good and i can't keep myself from not clapping Like in Oppenheimer where the whole theatre clapped for a minute;-1
""I personally don't see that doing big numbers like Oppenheimer but should have a good run. Both Scott and Phoenix alone are big enough pulls, but Scott's Box Office numbers aren't anywhere near Nolan or Gerwigs 2023 outings!"";-1
Oppenheimer was good. But seemed like 6 hours. Flower moon was half hour longer but seemed shorter. All depends on movie. Iâ€™ve seen some 90 min ones that felt forever;1
Idk if it was overhyped a bit cuz I thought it was pretty good movie yeah but the way it took over Twitter for a bit made me think it was like Oppenheimer levelsğŸ˜­;-1
Oppenheimer was a good movie and it didnâ€™t have bullshit like this.;1
Just finished Oppenheimer it was good I liked it I just wished it was um. Easier to follow. There were a lot of jumps in time where it was like forward -> backward -> forward -> backward. And I was like uum???? But it was good and I enjoyed it but I can't wait to sleep for 12 hrs;1
""Forgot to say that I finally saw Oppenheimer, and even though it's really good, I think it should've been a series of about 6 one hour long episodes. It was 3 hours long, and it still felt like it needed a lot more time to delve deeper into everything it wanted to show."";1
""Absolutely fucking insane, good job Christopher Nolan acknowledges the role of historians or Oppenheimer wouldâ€™ve ended like Dr Strangelove. Killed my excitement now."";1
""I see Oppenheimer is now available to rent or stream, probably as good a time as any to say I watched it in the cinema and the whole time I felt like I was being punished by the universe for all the bad things I'd done throughout my life"";-1
Before I embark on this 3hrs movie wey long like Lagos to Ore journey. How good is Oppenheimer?;-1
""Is #Oppenheimer a good movie? I really think so!  Is it worth my 3 hours? Yup!  P.S: If you failed Chemistry in high school (like myself), you may find some of the concepts in the film e.g nuclear fission a bit confusing. Make sure you Google"";1
Oh good..looks like they are not broadcasting the film clips on the livestream...at least not for Oppenheimer;-1
That is so false ğŸ˜‚. Oppenheimer was good but it was boring. It was a 3hr movie with people standing around talking about nuclear physics. I liked the movie but Iâ€™m not gonna sit here and act like i was at the edge of my seat;-1
""A movie that's less than 2 hours can test your patience if it's uninteresting. Indian audiences filled the theatres for movies like Avatar 2 & Oppenheimer which were 3 hours long. If the film has hype, good enough to hold your attention, then runtime should be the last concern."";-1
""I thought it was good, I just didnâ€™t like the filler that was in there for the last 45 minutes. If this wins best picture over Oppenheimer, Iâ€™ll be a little upset. And thatâ€™s coming from a Scorsese fan"";-1
""We both know Fast x and Mi just happened because they were released along side movies like Oppenheimer and Barbie.  Those franchises are always profitable, this is a fluke but their BO had its effects on the company none the less.  But for MCU things aren't looking so good."";-1
""but that works, its about who executes the things better.  even Oppenheimer took advantage of german experiment to make something.  others like Elon for Tesla.  that works, when you know the good game."";-1
watched 1st hour of #Oppenheimer  this arvo. i do plan to watch the rest. it's very interesting and a well filmed movie. i like how they show the different time eras without having to put dates up. not usually my type of movie but it does seem very good. i will continue.;1
i keep feeling like im such a downer re: movies people like and that i'm pretentious (true) but then i realize i was shaking crying throwing up about SANCTUARY and have not stopped thinking about MAY DECEMBER and had a visceral reaction to OPPENHEIMER and yeah i'm good;-1
GOOD! I liked it. Long but just cuz the court scenes I feel like weâ€™re long af like in Oppenheimer. I understand why we need it but itâ€™s like an extra hour.;-1
OPPENHEIMER MADE 10M LIKE THIS IS SO GOOD;1
lol imagine writing like a thousand deranged borderline frothing at the mouth posts about oppenheimer and then having the audacity to try and tell others they're coping and seething. people can enjoy more than one movie and two movies can be good. are you twelve arguing in the schoolyard having to defend one movie since your mom won't let you see both? let people enjoy things or go make your own movie so we can laugh at how bad it is (and it would be bad like so unbelievably bad that you would never recover). grow up.;-1
Saying it needs casuals when the movie just needs to be good donâ€™t feel mutually exclusive to me. Itâ€™s like Oppenheimer and Barbie. Thereâ€™s no fandoms there so thereâ€™s no casuals there so the movie was just relying on its narrative;-1
""watched Oppenheimer and noticed how he had reproduced the TV series but with tits. a good formula. Also he made use of the die hard unbeatable and aloof smug enemy, that is brought down in the end, also the earth blows up, death star like.  I approve of improving a dull story"";-1
""And because it isn't full of woke BS like suddenly deciding Oppenheimer should be played by a black, non-binary female that I will pay. The majority of stuff I will just pirate if I am interested anymore. If it is good and not woke I will pay after I see it."";-1
Probably Oppenheimer. Didnâ€™t expect to like it nearly as much as I did. Like I expected it to be good but not a masterpiece;-1
Experiment1: Try explaining a topic like evaporation and rainfall to yourself in Yoruba.  You might understand what Iâ€™m saying.  Experiment 2: do you think Oppenheimer would have been a good physicist if he was in Ibadan?;-1
""Napoleon reviews so far looking good - sounds like Ridley Scott has decided to tell a good story and not get too bogged down, learned lessons from Moscow campaign I see. Could bookend Oppenheimer nicely."";-1
Chernobyl is very underrated piece of cinema and since it's based on true events makes it more impactful just like Oppenheimer. Though dark was good in its genre but overhyped;-1
""Denzel Washington is such a good actor, he could collect someone else's award and everyone would be like """"He really crushed it in Oppenheimer"""""";-1
""Depends on if you're prioritizing image or sound and if the movie's aspect ratio is formatted to IMAX (like Oppenheimer). If you want the absolute best image, IMAX. But Dolby's image is still very good. However, Dolby's sound quality is the best by far, so I usually pick Dolby."";-1
it sounds like such a good ideaaaajfjsjfjdj i need to watch oppenheimer tho before i think;-1
""So good, we need more movies like OPPENHEIMER!"";1
Realising Oppenheimer is like Nolan's first legit really good movie since TDK…;1
""I honestly had to read this like 6x to make sure my brain was reading them correctly. Also, while Oppenheimer is complex/v. goodâ€¦ Iâ€™m not sure I would describe it as â€œnuanced,â€ really in ANY way. I mean a character walks into a room and 130 piece orchestra annihilates your ears."";1
""Oppenheimer is literally a tragedy. like a classic one. that's the whole point. it's morally complex because you see him wrestling with guilt and want to prevent him from going down that path. not because """"maybe it was kind of good they dropped the bomb"""""";-1
like i know awards are not the best metric for being a good actor and winners are just the singular choice of a voting body but if oppenheimer sweeps and cillian doesn't i'm definitely going to be salty i'm sorry;-1
""Wow, who knew the threat of Hitler getting a nuke wasn't real after all, and Oppenheimer just should've been like, """"naw, I'm good""""  Problem solved!"";-1
OPPENHEIMER is the closest weâ€™ll ever get to a character literally turning to the camera and saying â€œhereâ€™s what I think is Good and Badâ€ and even that wonâ€™t stop dumb takes like this!!!!!;-1
""It's not different, but many people in my country don't like Hollywood movies very much, and the threshold for watching movies for themselves is high.Only Oppenheimer has successfully won a good reputation in China this year."";-1
""Only Nolan's Oppenheimer has received a good reputation and a good box office in China this year.Because those people in my country don't like Hollywood blockbusters, especially superhero movies.My country has also produced a lot of bad movies this year"";-1
""Don't force yourself to watch something you don't like or understand just to look cool. Films should be about entertainment. That aside, Oppenheimer is a good film, but it's not that technical"";1
""Oppenheimer was very good , Nolan finally made a great movie after 10 years, felt like it was made by a mix of peak Spielberg and Oliver Stone, the climax scene was funny though like redid the Dark Knight ending monologue with Oppenheimer lol"";1
""oppenheimer was reddit and cringe until about the second half, and then the second half was about as good as like a random old law and order episode"";-1
The Aviator > Oppenheimer by a lot imo  so Iâ€™m glad Scorsese made it. I like Nolan but it wouldnâ€™t have been nearly as good.;-1
""It's taken half my weekend, but I've finished watching Oppenheimer. I'm often quite critical of Nolan films, but this is good. Really, really good. I'd say it's probably my favourite of his to be honest. Still a bit too long, but didn't feel unnecessarily long like some"";-1
rdj wasnt even THAT good in oppenheimerâ€¦ like i couldâ€™ve done that;-1
""It should literally just say, â€œAre We Underestimating The Holdovers?â€  Itâ€™s trying to say â€œis it actually good or is it Green Book?â€ because itâ€™s a feel good holiday-set movie about people with issues and that shouldnâ€™t win over something big like Oppenheimer, which is stupid."";-1
insanely good casting. the guy who played the old oppenheimer looks just like him.;-1
""They say the best supporting actor race is between these 2 but imo the clear winner should be Gosling. I like both but Gosling always takes risks & steals Barbie as a comedic revelation. While Downey Jr. is also good, he just plays another variation of the same guy in Oppenheimer"";-1
""Nature will heal, of course, but for now the breakouts are going to be more Audacious Oddballs--like the Taylor Swift movie, FNAF, and Barbie. And we all know that as good as Oppenheimer was, it wasn't going to make those numbers solo (look at KotFM)."";-1
OPPENHEIMER felt like it had a tablespoon of Scorsese in it. This is a good thing. This partly amounts to assembling an insane collection of character actors and letting them do that.   Harry S. Truman:;-1
""Saw the trailer for Godzilla Zero in IMAX ahead of Oppenheimer and while it looks like the best version of Godzilla to come around in a while, I still couldnâ€™t help but feel like so we really need another Godzilla movie. No matter how good it is, Iâ€™m not the only one with Godzilla exhaustion."";-1
""Unless, its a popular franchise like FNAF or Barbie then yeah you do. Before you say Oppenheimer, the cast did all the interview press before the strike started.  Love and Thunder, Secret Invasion and Quantumania destroyed the good will of the MCU so the brand doesnt hold itself"";-1
Granted I'm not as big of a fan of Christopher Nolan as a lot of people but Oppenheimer was really good.  My rankings of ones I like.  1. Insomnia 2. Oppenheimer 3. Batman begins 4. Dark Knight 5. The prestige;-1
WHAT HOW. OPPENHEIMER WAS SO GOOD. Like it definitely used its runtime effectively;1
""Also, Florence's role in Oppenheimer wasn't really worth writing home about? She's in the movie for like 5 minutes tops. She's good and she left an impression, but it's not as big of a deal as their tweet is making it out to be."";-1
finally watched oppenheimer was good but dunno if i like it as much as most seem to guess is because action/comedy is more my thing;-1
""Oppenheimer really was like the Avengers for real nerds, not dorks. Lol. Crazy that really happened man. And that was the good option for how things couldâ€™ve played out."";-1
Watching Oppenheimer again makes me truly appreciate the background soundtracks. ğŸ¤ŒğŸ¤Œ  Like how is it so good!?;1
I don't care and I think it's the dumbest thing for randos on the internet to care about how much Disney or Universal is going to earn.Till the time I get good movies like TKOTFM or the killer or Oppenheimer be it anywhere streaming or theatre I am happy;-1
Yep. Cillian is crazy good cos at no point during the entire screen time did i think he was anyone but Robert Oppenheimer. Like this guy has bodied the role of Thomas Shelby for so long and yet transmits an energy so distinct itâ€™s impossible to think them the same person;-1
You didnâ€™t think Oppenheimer was a good film?  To me felt like best movie I have seen in many years;1
""This is a good reading imo, esp because Oppenheimer himself doesn't really seem like the hero of the story;-1";" he's driven by forces beyond himself, he stumbles through history as in a dream."
""lil catch-up time  been working. i kinda like it. just opening boxes and putting nice smelling stuff in shelves.  watched oppenheimer. i discovered that i might be what RLM describes as an """"inception-bro"""". the movie is good though. just not my favorite nolan"";-1
""How do movies like Super Mario Brothers, Barbie and Oppenheimer fit into the equation?  Are they just anomalies to be removed or are they proof that if a movie is good it will draw viewers to the theater?   I'm not convinced shat talking on the internet and the pandemic is it."";-1
I thought Oppenheimer was meant to be goodâ€¦..Iâ€™m two hours in and Iâ€™m feeling absolutely nothing like itâ€™s so dull;0
""I thought it did a good job depicting oppenheimer, his personality and motivations. I want to believe the attention the women got was a reflection of how he felt about them and the position held in his life. It's called Oppenheimer not the suffering of the Japanese so like..."";-1
""the barbie craze really confused me, like it was good, but no where NEAR oppenheimer and it STILL did more than a billion in box office only god knows how"";-1
""I would love it if both were equally as good but, like, Oppenheimer doesn't have a literal Chevy car ad inserted into the middle of the runtime, so that's impossible."";-1
""Barbie was an incredibly average and I mean that in the nicest way possible. I just never understood the hype about it, it wasnâ€™t that memorable and it was good enough for a one time viewing lol. Oppenheimer is like fine wine;1";" I love seeing short clips bc itâ€™s that good"
""Buddy my favorite films this year has been Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Across the Spider-verseâ€¦ just because I donâ€™t like dogshit that DC has been given doesnâ€™t mean I thinks itâ€™s him or nothing.   Iâ€™m looking forward to Joker Folie a Deux.   I like good films."";1
Watched Oppenheimer last night with the wifey and step daughterâ€¦.didnâ€™t seem like 3hrsâ€¦.very good movie;1
""Just finished watching oppenheimer. Am I surprised that I did not really like another movie strongly praised by the whole world? Not really. Classic hollywood editorialism to the max. Plenty of good acting , loved Ben Sadfie as Ed Teller. I thin I just don't really like Nolan tho"";-1
""Iâ€™m gonna rewatch the best biopic ever (Oppenheimer) and then chill and finish some artwork, looks like itâ€™s gonna be a pretty good day ngl"";1
""Good. I want more films like Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, The Killer and hopefully Rebel Moon.  I just want this era of light-hearted capeshit to end."";1
""I mean it was great, but idk if it really compares to something like oppenheimer's, and it probably wouldn't be as good to non mario fans anyways"";-1
oppenheimer is so fucking good like i can't believe i liked it this much;1
""seeing some RDJ-in-oppenheimer slander on the TL. a great, complex turn from an actor clearly thrilled to step out of his comfort zone. downey jr winning an oscar for this would be like if pacino won for the insider or something â€” almost too good to be true"";-1

mfs talked amor oppenheimer like that movie was good;1
""Glad to see it run itâ€™s course, time for other film not associated with super heroes to take over. Seeing stuff like Oppenheimer and Barbie kill it at the box office and the marvels flopping is good signal that movies are back."";-1
i saw maybe like 2/100 good edits on oppenheimer so far;-1
oppenheimer was genuinely on another level only good movie ive seen in like the past four years;1
""Like all good movies, Oppenheimer owes its existence to Donkey Kong."";1
""Yeah. I didnâ€™t care for Oppenheimer that much tbh. It was really good and very well made, but itâ€™s more like a movie youâ€™d watch in a class"";1
""Alden Ehrenreich is so goddamn good, and I really hope that Oppenheimer lets him do more of what he loves.  And man, that last bit is like... So endearing lol"";-1
""All these Oppenheimer scenes that we can now download are not good for me, Iâ€™m downloading them like someone who has storage spaceâ€¦"";-1
""Itâ€™s hilarious to me how many awards predictors significantly lack actual media literacy or understanding of what constitutes good craft. I keep seeing the criticism from them that the last third of Oppenheimer seems out of place and boring, and likeâ€¦.what?? WATCH THE MOVIE!!!"";-1
""Killers of the Flower Moon was good but it didn't manage to surpass the sheer brilliance and impact of Oppenheimer, and I ain't talking about box office but even critically. I feel like The Academy will not favour Oppenheimer due to a great box office run."";-1
Entire oppenheimer movie was a good example of that. Despite being a brilliant man oppenheimer believed in retarded shit like communism;-1
""The editing in #Oppenheimer is overlooked and I think it has one of the best editing this year, like how do you tie these anxious scenes soo good and smooth. No wonder it's the hereditary editor. Great work man."";1
i think possibly bc ppl like to conflate line reading with line of dialogue that was good and conflate line of dialogue that was good with line of dialogue that is important. oppenheimer is filled to the brim with dialogue thatâ€™s important but no realâ€¦actual natural dialogue imo;-1
""Why did all the insufferable fucking film nerds have to attach themselves to a pretty good movie?  Like, yeah Oppenheimer probably does deserve an Oscar or two but now I donâ€™t want it to get anything because you wonâ€™t shut the fuck up about it."";-1
Feels wrong watching all these Oppenheimer clips on the tl on my phone but MAN it still feels like a once in a lifetime kind of movie. Itâ€™s insane how good it is.;-1
""Heard some ppl complain that Oppenheimer leans too heavy on its score, but like even if that was true itâ€™d still be a masterpiece bc of how insanely good the score is"";-1
""Oppenheimer is the only movie I saw in a theater this year, but it was very good.  Napoleon will be the next one."";1
""Good days are coming when films like Mrs.Marvel,Secret Invasion are gonna flop and real films come back.The first time an adults movie,Oppenheimer had higher collection than any MCU film in 2023"";-1
""Why am I such a philistine that every single clip from Oppenheimer that I see makes me think itâ€¦just doesnâ€™t look that good? It all looks like bad acting. Actors trying to sound and look important, not actual, interesting performances"";-1
i know im the resident hater but i cannot say i thought about Oppenheimer once after seeing it. like it was Fine. categorically â€œA Good Movieâ€ but i felt almost Nothing and remember Little;-1
""I don't get it ğŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸ His character seemed like a cartoon villain by the end of the film. That scene is a good example. With his character being a real dude, I expected a less black-and-white portrayal. Oppenheimer was given more layers."";-1
seeing all the clips on twitter today Iâ€™m like damn Oppenheimer rly was that fuckin good;1
""It's insane how much Oppenheimer not only holds up but improves on a 2nd watch. Hits so different, the speech after Trinity is obviously not as physically intense at home like IMAX but the quieter bits land more. Fuck it's so good. Dune may be beat for the best of the 20s so far."";-1
Today feels like a good day to watch some #Oppenheimer;-1
watching clips of oppenheimer ahead of its digital release on a nonstop loop like a woman possessed because how am i supposed to stop when the material is this good;-1
getting stressed out over josh hartnett's shitty filmography then relaxing when i remember he was just in oppenheimer so might get cast in some good stuff now then putting my head in my hands when i see his next movie is going to be like 10th billed in a james franco joint;-1
Iâ€™m totally down for that but Iâ€™m also likeâ€¦. Oppenheimer is just so fucking good you know? I truly think itâ€™s Nolanâ€™s best since Prestige for me;1
Every time I see a clip from Oppenheimer I remember how good of a film it is like damn;1

""One of the things I like about #Oppenheimer movie is that it makes you think. Moral dilemma. That guilt. Justification.  It raises more questions than it answers. It will start a debate. One important word here is """"conflict"""" & another is """"regret""""  Movie was good ğŸ‘ Thoughtful."";-1
""It was so good it felt like it was 3 minutes not 3 hours  Real things are always much better than fiction , the real cruel world with gray colored glasses .. #Oppenheimer"";1

""#Oppenheimer(2023) felt like watching """"Guru"""" indian movie. I really like the 2nd part of it. But you have to keep your focus on the screen to understand what is happening. It is good, if you watch it by understanding what they were talking about. So wait for Tamil Audio. 3/5 â­ï¸"";-1
""Yeah I donâ€™t like that â€œSorkinâ€ criticism because that last hour is better than anything Sorkin has done in a decade and has real emotionally behind it. Sorry you didnâ€™t like it, but to me, itâ€™s what makes Oppenheimer the best film of the year. Barbie is a good picture though."";1
""I donâ€™t think they want Oppenheimer too look like a good guy in the film. I think that was more about the remorse felt.   However, historical accuracy to the nth degree in films is a misguided concept anyways. Iâ€™m not there for a documentary ğŸ‘ğŸ¾"";-1
Barbie was good but I couldnâ€™t even enjoy like that because I was having new Oppenheimer flashbacks every 5 minutes;-1

""Wait, so youâ€™re arguing that Oppenheimer had never seen a Japanese person before?  Because how he would â€œhave the ability to see what they would look likeâ€ is the same way any of us do.   Go ahead;-1";"  imagine a Japanese person dying from a bomb. You managed it, right? Good job."
""Oppenheimer was decent at best tbf, another script with cheap WT that looked like it was written by a 10yo. Like interstellar all over again. Cillian was great tho.  As for your comment, people with very good taste watched both. Itâ€™s rlly stupid to miss out on a Gerwig â€˜s film."";-1
Good director i dont like everything he makes but Oppenheimer was good.;1
""I mean, a lot of people have made the JFK comparison with OPPENHEIMER and I think that runs deeper than just the structure of the movie itself, itâ€™s also how movies like that used to be made all the time and they weee big commercial successes because they were good!"";-1
""If an 82-80 team that was unwatchable and is headed nowhere causes  owner to be like """"we good"""" & GM to rip everyone else, what exactly will ever change?  There is zero accountability in that organization.  Boone, Cashman, Fishman, Oppenheimer all great. How dare you question that"";-1

You forgot Oppenheimer which is so much better than Killers of the Flower Moon. Napoleon and Ferrari should be good though and hopefully not drag towards the end like Killers.;-1
Ridley Scott really did forget how to make good movies after Gladiator. Like dawg the whole point of a biopic is to be accurate. You are releasing this the same year as Oppenheimer and killers of the flower moon ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€;-1
I like the ending scene in Oppenheimer. I also like the dog scenes in Anatomy of a Fall. It's a real good  dog actor.;-1
""I saw both! They were both right up my alley, and I came into both with sky-high expectations. KOTFM smashed every expectation I had, went above and beyond what I couldâ€™ve hoped for. I didnâ€™t dislike Oppenheimer, I just got out of it and was like â€œokay thatâ€™s good.â€"";-1
""When I finally see Oppenheimer in a few weeks I'm not going to act like it's the best thing since sliced bread CN still has a chance to make some stinkers I've made that mistake  too many times with directors I've admired over the years If it's good, it's good :)"";-1
""@RealJamesWoods is a exceptionally good Actor. Anyone who doesn't see that is a joke. Actors are people & have opinions like everyone else. Just because his opinions don't align with others, is 0 reason to bash him. He was Executive Producer on Oppenheimer. Not a """"wash up"""" to me"";-1
Thatâ€™s true. Oppenheimer had insane marketing and did it for MONTHS and made it clear. Killers had good trailers but not much outside of that. Def targeting the more older crowd who likes movies like it;-1
""Sounds about right.  I saw Oppenheimer at the theatre with my Dad and afterwords he said it was â€œpretty goodâ€. I was like damn, he must have absolutely loved it"";1
""I think in comparison, i prefer weathering with you and your name, but suzume was still great. It's like saying you prefer oppenheimer to interstellar or vise versa. It doesn't make the one you don't like as much any less good because of what it's being compared to ğŸ¤”"";-1

""I would like my friend more if she didn't keep ambushing me with other people when the plan is """"the two of us do a thing"""". Luckily, she never contacts me first so I can now wait at least a year possibly more before next time. 3 hours of Oppenheimer is enough for a good while!"";-1
""Watched Killers of the flower moon. Lame overall, couple of good acting performances but the movie does not do justice to it's story. It's a nothing movie, just like Oppenheimer this year. If I wanted to see any DOP skills I would watch some BBC wildlife show."";-1
""This is a narrative either to lower the cost of movies(hardly), or a marketing hype like with Oppenheimer and some others. At the end of the day, the movie is good or bad. Everything else is irrelevant. On the other hand, CGI has become a substitute for a good story."";-1

""Rami Malik was good in Mr Robot and used perfectly in Oppenheimer (like a single line), but the fact he won the Oscar for best actor for this seams incredibly cheap considering he didnâ€™t even sing"";-1

""Hollywood is getting boring now except for those prestigious films like KOTFM, Oppenheimer, Barbie etc.  India is making some really good Blockbusters - RRR, Pathaan , Jawan  Upcoming releases are Tiger 3, Animal, Dunki, Salaar, Fighter, Pushpa The Rise, Kalki 2989 AD , War 2 etc"";-1
I pray that RDJ never go back to that circus. Seeing him in OPPENHEIMER was just too good for the heart. I need him in more stuff like this.;-1
It was a really good mystery. I like his writing style and will definitely be reading more of his books. Now I need to see Oppenheimer.;-1
DUDE WHY WAS THE FNAF MOVIE SO GOOD?!  LIKE THAT SHIT SLAPPED HARDER THAN OPPENHEIMER.  GO WATCH IT!!;-1
I think it becomes Oppy vs The Holdovers.  I think the only thing that can stop a technical EVENT of a film like Oppenheimer is a good old fashioned crowd-pleaser.;-1
""Honestly mana hyd valam peddha Miss avatle, 4K laser is always better than dual 2K xenons.   But yeah, it's good and I can see movies like Oppenheimer being a very good experience here. The sound system was good too"";-1
""And it's still arbitrary. Don't misunderstand me, it's a good tool for diagnosis, but it's not that precise. Person with 142 IQ is not necessarily smarter than the one with 137. Also, there are historical examples. Like Oppenheimer. He had like 125iq and people were intimidated"";-1
""It's good, you get to go out and have fun but you don't have to spend months planning how to look like sexy Oppenheimer."";-1
Man Oppenheimer has like ZERO good places to piss. In the span of 30 seconds you could miss some giant revelation. I held it for that fucking movie yesus.;-1
Disagree. Terminator is a good example. Sex scenes just to sell tickets are always trash though. Like the one in Oppenheimer.;-1
""Thank you, Alan @Moviesontheway Always good to see you and hope all is well, my friend. Academy Awards Best Film - OPPENHEIMER ? I bet you are disappointed like I am that DUNE is delayed until at least March 2024."";-1

Oppenheimer moved like molasses. Good film but Flower Moon was an action thriller compared to it for me.;-1
""I'm going to try to start putting together a list of ~10 best movies of 2023 but so far I can think of, like, 3 movies (ASTV, Barbie, and maybe Oppenheimer but I haven't seen it yet)  what movies came out this past year that are actually good?"";-1
But in nolan film you find really good emotions like interstellar prestige TDK trilogy oppenheimer that stands out good i don't agree here much actually yeah scorsese films chi editing and pacing is very slow he Manya kara aple sarkha movie buff pahu shaktat;-1
A good film like Killers of Flowers Moon not working at Box Office is big disappointment man.  On the other hand Nolan's #Oppenheimer almost touched $1B at Box Office which was dialogue heavy. What a monumental feat in this context.  Like it or not Nolan is the brand!;-1

Thereâ€™s been like 2 days since Iâ€™ve seen it where I havenâ€™t thought about Oppenheimer itâ€™s so fucking good;1
""Interstellar was amazing, Oppenheimer was good but was too long. Felt like it was half an hour longer than it shouldâ€™ve been"";1
""Bam! We are there. And like Oppenheimerâ€™s invention, the wait is worth the blast! This year was the hardest because weâ€™ve seen so very, very few movies. But Oppenheimer was good."";1
I just watched Cobwebs last night on Hulu. Good movie. Also was released same time as Barbie/Oppenheimer (sp?). Sank like a rock. Would have been perfect to release it now. (And it takes place around Halloween.);-1

""Wolf of Wall Street was so good for like an hour, but I found myself noticing how long it dragged on the back end. Same feeling with Oppenheimer actually.  Departed is one of the more re-watchable movies out there. Every actor nails their part"";-1
""Not convinced by Oppenheimer or KOTFM either. But Barbie isnâ€™t the answer. A feel-good film like The Holdovers has more in common with likes of Green Book and CODA. Da'Vine Joy Randolph could win Supporting Actress, then itâ€™s only a Screenplay win away from being a BP contender."";-1
""I seen the money, and honestly Oppenheimer seemed like a longer viewing. Itâ€™s a good movie"";1
""Saw it tonight with my old man. It 100% needs an intermission.   It'd be a great 2.5 Hour movie, much like Oppenheimer, just has too much fluff. Still Good, but too long to be great."";-1
CURRENT 2023 MOVIE RATING(from what ive seen thus far):  1. The Little Mermaid 2023 (YES ITS GOOD SHUT UP) 2. The Super Mario Bros. Movie 3. FNAF 4. Barbie 5. GOTG Vol.3  6. M3GAN 7. Oppenheimer (It was boring but i understand why people like it);-1
""Ultimately both Oppenheimer and KOTFM are the types of movies we would like to see more of, and both are at the top of my current best of the 2020s list so you canâ€™t really go wrong here. This is such a good year for cinema."";-1
Intellectual movie like Oppenheimer crossed 150 crores in India. People want to spend there hard earned money wisely on good Cinema not on your forced patriotism cinema.;-1
Oppenheimer got like $10.5M so it's REALLY good Considering the fact that the budget was 20 million;-1
Oppenheimer isn't a mass marketed PG-13 franchised movie made for kids though.  Not really a good comparison. Comparing it to something like the Jack Black Goosebumps movie would probably be better.;-1

The comparison is that oppenheimer is huge and fnaf is huge. Some of us donâ€™t know what â€œgoodâ€ box office numbers are so comparisons like this help us see ğŸ˜­;-1

""The style of film is clearly inspired by other biopics like JFK or Nixon... but Oppenheimer is nowhere near as good as either of those movies, IMO.  I gave it a 7.5/10. Good but not great."";-1

""Very well said, and definitely an issue of how that movie was made or written to reflect their interpretation of Oppenheimer instead of what he was actually like. And thatâ€™s a good point, there is merit there."";-1
""It feels like that period has a lot of good films, but not many great ones.  Joker tops the list for me. It's nearly perfect.  Dune, 1917, Oppenheimer, Elvis, and Knives Out were all very good.   Tenet was technically amazing, but for me it it lacked something."";1
some of the best films got out of that age with revenge of the sith and the tobey spiderman trilogy but this current era is also very good with gotg3 and atsv and oppenheimer and series like loki s2 and ahsoka…;-1
""Is it really a stacked year? I only see three movies that seem like clear nom front-runners rn.  Past Lives Killers of the Flower Moon Anatomy of a Fall  There's a good chance that Oppenheimer, Poor Things and Napoleon (if it's good) get nominated, but there's room for Spidey."";-1

like oppenheimer was technically a good movie on all technical fronts with clear artistic intent but such a deeply draining slogfest that i wouldn't sit through it again ykwim;1
Oppenheimer did the 3 hour movie run justice. I felt like I wanted more. It was that good. The last time Nolan made such a big movie was with interestellar and that felt way too long and boring imo. Oppenheimer is easily Nolans best film to date since inception;1
That's actually the reason why people listen to theme songs like interstellar or Oppenheimer.  Because the movies themselves are so good;1
My wife put this on and about 20 minutes in said â€œThis isnâ€™t very good is it?â€   Like wtf were you expecting? Oppenheimer? Itâ€™s a horror movie based on Winnie the Pooh. Sure it could have been done better but come on ğŸ˜‚;-1
Itâ€™s very obviously a career award at this point which wouldnâ€™t bug me so much if Oppenheimer had been any good. Ryan Gosling would be more deserving but a nomination for Barbie is the award since its not the type of movie they would likely throw an award like that for.;-1
""I think this film was brilliantly made. the editing, pacing, tension - it's all astonishingly good. the 206-minute (!!) runtime had me scared but I was never bored. that in itself is a remarkable feat. but, as with oppenheimer, I got to the end and was like I KNOW WHITE MEN SUCK"";-1
Sounds like Oppenheimer all over again. For me itâ€™s a good indicator that I must see what theyâ€™re complaining about asap;-1
to be honest it didn't feel quite it's length in the cinema. looks really good but doesn't have spectacular big sequences like OPPENHEIMER. tbh I'll always recommend going because I find it so much more immersive.;-1

So good to see movies like this and Oppenheimer doing great business. Maybe true cinema isn't dead.;1
Looking like a good year for film. Seems both Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon will go down in history;-1
""Agreed. I really didnâ€™t expect it to suck but Iâ€™ve never been much of a Nolan person so Oppenheimer surprising me by being THAT good is like, one of the best experiences Iâ€™ve had in a theatre recently"";-1
Oppenheimer wasnâ€™t a feel-good story either.  This OW does seem low for what looked like an event movie. Maybe the second weekend hold will show people were waiting for WOM.;-1
Most of scary movie series is good to me but hate horror movies.    More into biopics and historical stuff like elvis and oppenheimer;-1

""Mmm KOTFM was a good, proper movie, Oppenheimer is on a whole other level. Kotfm had great acting and photography , but lacks the editing, sound mixing and dialogs of Oppenheimer to be on that level of masterpiece (I do thing it's a great movie, but not an all timer like oppie)"";1
I feel the same way. It was such a good addition to the MI movies. There definitely were many factors. Oppenheimer nabbed a lot of IMAX screens like a week or two later. Cruise was pissed about it. The budget blew too because they filmed during the whole pandemicâ€¦;-1
I like Chris but he couldnâ€™t even direct a good sex scene in Oppenheimer lollllll KotFM was perfect;-1
Accidentally got a drink at Bubba Gump's that was like 3 shots of rum before seeing Oppenheimer (2nd time) so I cannot comment on the food. The Toothsome Emporium has pretty good dessert and drinks but incredibly lousy food. NBC Grill was fine but I only got wings & beer so ymmv;-1

Heâ€™s so all in on wanting to praise them for doing theatrical right by letting Ace see it for free. Maybe one of his Oppenheimer/Barbie rare lukewarm takes where he declares itâ€™s not as good as Martyâ€™s earlier work like Wolf Of Wall Street.;-1

""One was recently shot downâ€”MH17. It had all these viral disease experts on board like Joep Lange. Then five years later COVID hit. Joep was the Oppenheimer of fighting viruses. They had to take him out to maximize the Covid operation effectiveness, in my view. Good men = targets."";-1
""Certainly neither Casino nor Oppenheimer felt like 3 hours!  Barry Lyndon and The Deer Hunter do feel like 3 hours to me, but in a good way -- you want to appreciate what time is doing to the characters."";-1
""like letâ€™s see: 5. Heat 4. 12 Angry Men 3. Oppenheimer  2. Good Will Hunting 1. D&D Honor Among Thieves  Spiderverse is like, 6 or 7th I canâ€™t lie, when I first got out the theater I was pumped and Iâ€™ve since lost all said hype on a exponential level"";-1
I used to think that I can't watch long movies but I sat through Oppenheimer like my seat was glued. People are just being a bit too anxious about it for no good reason.;-1
When a movie is really good then it doesn't feel long. Oppenheimer was 3-hours and felt like 2-hours.;1
""turning on light mode is like that flash in oppenheimer, except oppenheimer was really really good and light mode is shit"";1
What I would feed the cast of Oppenheimer based on how much I like them: Oppenheimer: Grilled cheese Lewis Strauss: Grilled cheese The One Played By Bennie Safdie: Grilled Cheese Oppenheimer's Sneaky Link: Grilled Cheese I am not very good at cooking they all gettin a dam sandwch;-1
""I love cinema. I love the theater. What I do not love is a long ass movie like D*ne that is empty as fuck. However, a good bit of cInEmA these days is giving us a stock pot of crumbs.  Give me extended-edition LOTR! The Godfather! Endgame! Oppenheimer!"";-1
omo I just realise say him really no get Oscar wtf after all this classics?? Bro the cast of Oppenheimer was too good I don't know if Oscar dey give best ensembled cast like emmy but it deserves it;-1
""I trust Scorsese and that heâ€™ll keep the pace consistent. I like a good 3 hr movie but I feel that some recent ones like Avatar, The Batman, and Beau is Afraid could have been trimmed.  Babylon and Oppenheimer made good use of their runtimes."";-1
i feel like that if christopher nolan did this for oppenheimer the average hearing capacity would lower significantly (this is a good thing);-1
""I liked Barbie more than Oppenheimer, too.  I haven't seen Killers yet because I don't have *connections* like you do ğŸ˜¢ I predict that even if Killers wins Best Picture (which is definitely possible) Nolan will win Best Director as a make-good for being snubbed in the past"";-1
Oh the Barbie dance was very good on #strictly but Iâ€™d equally have like to see the Oppenheimer dance!!!  @bbcstrictly #barbie;-1
""You know that part in Oppenheimer,  where they make him apply for security clearance for the device he built.   But it was all just a game to tie it up.  I see you nodding your heads like it's a good idea.   It's yours,  it's everyone's.  We paid for it,  we found it.  Check the physics research papers for the confirmation you're looking for."";-1
""because reality is, Oppenheimer had ZERO REGRETS for what he did in REALITY. Go find the footage. He is celebrated, he smiles, he acts like what he has done is a good thing.  He was a vicious evil Jew, who hated Germans and wanted the bomb used on Germany."";-1
""If Killers of the Flower Moon is as good as critics are saying, trying to figure out what is better between it and Oppenheimer is going to be like watching 2019 LSU and 2020 Alabama play for a national championship."";-1
""I think thereâ€™s also a difference between a movie like transformers and a film like Oppenheimer? I mean the goal from the studio/ director is clearly different. You canâ€™t compare Avengers Endgame to Prisoners, doesnâ€™t mean they canâ€™t both be good. Film vs Movie is a thing imo."";-1
""Elon, you are the Oppenheimer of our time. Just like heâ€™s the father of the Atomic Bomb and tried to stop the development of the H-bomb, you ushered in great technological advances in our age for good intentions, but the devil has a way of exploiting technology to the detriment of Society. Beware good sir."";-1
yeah i think he did a good job at showing what happened and at that point we didnt even have explicit footage of what has happened yet in japan yet in his mind he knew how atrocious it was already bc it was his own monster the movie is named oppenheimer not japan anyway like;-1
and then was like. in oppenheimer and was pretty good ? good for him;-1
""This year, it feels like the movies that did well (Super Mario Bros, Spider-Verse, Barbie, Oppenheimer) were driven by audience's interest in seeing something different. Some of Barbenheimer was just hype I guess but it was helped that they were both good, creator-driven movies"";-1
More than biopic its a brilliant rescue movie. Atleast not boring like overhyped #Oppenheimer . Only VFX has some issues. Rest all good. #missionraniganj;-1
I said to my brother that our mom is a barbie girl while we're Oppenheimer guys and she took offense to that.  But it's fucking true she finds good shit like the Wire and the Bear boring but she always wants to watch movies with cute cats;-1
Psa i donâ€™t know who needs to hear this but live tweeting and tweeting on this ass platform while watching a movie as complex like Oppenheimer is not a good idea at all Not any movie now that I think about it;-1
Ok that makes sense now  Try watching the really good stuff like Oppenheimer or Past Lives  Killers of the Flower Moon in 2 weeks;-1
""I'd like to think that while there are some really good movies still coming out even today, few are worth a $14 theater ticket and less are worth premium format. Barbie, Oppenheimer (70mm IMAX), Spiderverse, and Guardians are the few exceptions for me this year."";-1
""Iâ€™m so happy for you! That sounds like a good plan first show of the day, I may actually try thatâ€¦ I donâ€™t wanna wait for Oppenheimer to be out with my audio description and watch it on my iPadâ€¦ It deserves the theatre, but I like cinema betterâ¤ï¸"";-1
""That and RDJ for Oppenheimer. I like him as much as the next guy, and he was really good in the movie, but putting on a stern face for a collective 20 minutes ain't exactly Oscar worthy."";-1

""Over on TikTok, there was a Fan claiming that """"RDJ is wrong, Oppenheimer isn't his best work. It's Iron Man.""""   Like, dude. You can't claim a star is wrong on their OWN opinion about their OWN body of work.   RDJ has a good body of work, I'd have said """"Judge""""."";-1

""I honestly feel like the only reason people hate Nolan movies is because they a juuuust good looking enough to be considered """"prestige"""" but the content is lower-middlebrow action/adventure (haven't seen Oppenheimer) which infuriates Serious Film people"";-1
""I don't mind his statement tbh it's oppenheimer after all, the movie was too good rather how blatantly hes said that without even taking movies like endgame or infinity war in consideration is a little disappointing but still its fine it is what it is"";-1
Quantum Mechanics from the Oppenheimer OST sounds like a good warm up exercise for string crossings in the violin hahaha;-1
Only Oppenheimer made bank. The others are only successes because of low budgets. But itâ€™s all good! I laugh at you cinephiles so damn muchâ€¦ yâ€™all are so ridiculous and so mad people like what you donâ€™t ğŸ˜‚;-1
""Ok, this is the movie thread now.   A bit late, but I saw Oppenheimer. Sumptuous. A feat of editing: fast paced and non-chronological, like a stream of consciousness, but never tiring, despite the 3-hour length. Good stuff. Gimme more."";-1
""""""Dear liberals, did you know you are too good of a human being who just works too hard and finds racism too morally evil to take the low road in order to win more elections?"""" is like what von Neumann said about Oppenheimer's psychological wailing. No, it's EXACTLY what he said."";-1
""Good question. It's hard to measure now because of black swan dynamics, but 30-50 years from now we will know. Like Oppenheimer, perhaps."";-1
Thanks man like this is an example of how my readings would be for movies Iâ€™ve seen  Rise of Gru-7/10=Pretty Good  Dungeons and Dragons-8.5/10=Great  Spider-Verse-9/10=Amazing  Oppenheimer-10/10=Fantastic or A Masterpiece;-1
I havent seen the trailer but it sounds like its gonna be  like oppenheimer just talking with no action (Oppenheimer is good movie tho) +  FNAF movie is second most anticipated movies of october;-1
Pretty much. I feel like everything peaked mid-2010â€™s. I mostly watch old releases now. There are occasional exceptions. â€œOppenheimerâ€ was good.;-1
""Thatâ€™s crazy, almost as if Oppenheimer got really good score but was a shit and boring movie overall.  Donâ€™t listen to scores. Donâ€™t be that person. Like whatever you want. Scream 3 was my favourite Scream film but you donâ€™t have to like it."";-1
""tbh it's smh unfair to compare these movies, two completely diff genres, you won't be certain that a guy who's a fan of superhero films to enjoy movies like oppenheimer or vice versa, a cinephile on the other hand would enjoy both the set of movies as he knows what good cinema is"";-1

""But Oppenheimer did things that no other R-rated biopic, especially on a person like J. Robert Oppenheimer, has ever done. Other beloved IPâ€™s (like Phantom Menace as mentioned earlier, for example) can be breakaway hits, it just has to be good enough"";-1
""Malema has good ideas, but he's making a crucial mistake... He blames white people. Those calling the shots, like the Oppenheimers aren't white at all, and he knows it. They belong to the group that's behind the whole """"white supremacy"""" concept, and they admit to it proudly."";-1
""iâ€™ve still only seen the Dead movies and The Crazies but clearly heâ€™s the urtext for post-studio era Social Issue Horror. some of his worst imitators probably made him feel like Oppenheimer. good thing he has a next-level feel for gore, blunt critique, momentum and Horror Humor."";-1
Good to know! Yeah I wasnâ€™t too surprised by the generalization of creator like that considering some techies said oppenheimer was like â€œdecelâ€ / â€œanti techâ€ progress lol. They are gonna stretch the points of  creator too ğŸ’€;-1
i have other books abt j. robert oppenheimer and the manhattan project on my reading list it's so bad ğŸ˜­ but i need everyone to read american prometheus it's really good and honestly reads more like a story and also reading it turns the movie into the best movie ever;-1
i thought oppenheimer was really good.  some music was way too lengthy. felt like the same melody played for 30 min;1
the Oppenheimer soundtrack has me on a chokehold ever since i saw it at the cinemas like itâ€™s SO GOOD;1
""My favorite still Nolan's movie like Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception, The Dark Knight and the new one: Oppenheimer. Yg lain mungkin kaya film2 macam The Shawsank Redemption, The Pianist, Fight Club, Good Will Hunting, The Imitation Game, 3 Idiots, Little Miss Sunshine."";1
Oppenheimer was really damn good. I didnâ€™t think I would be able to sit thru a 3 hour movie like that;1
i thought RDJ and Emily Blunt were fine in Oppenheimer. Like sure they're good but not that memorable to me.;-1
Oppenheimer is a better movie Barbie is a fun time. It depends on what you like but both are really good.;1
#SalaarVsDunki is Going to be like #BarbieVsOppenheimer  Or #Barbenheimer  Where #Barbie is #Dunki BCS of its Tone and Color Grading and Content wise a Fresh and Feel Good films Where #SalaarCeaseFire is #Oppenheimer with DarkTheme   So Another Huye Clash After this  Excited;-1
""The Penguin #2 A bit tone down from the last issue, overall just character driven of a character you usually didn't care for It's like the Oppenheimer situation when it's a good story of a man you normally didn't care for, but it's well written 6/10"";-1
Good runtime cause low key sitting in the theater for almost 3 hours is getting kinda tiresome for me. It works for other movie like Oppenheimer or an Avengers movie cause itâ€™s like an event film. Iâ€™m starting to appreciate short runtime films again.;-1
""But does Poor Things have the heart? Does it have heart or is it another The Favourite? That's the real question.  Everything Everywhere was weird, but it was grounded in Hollywood underdogs and a feel-good story.  Oppenheimer still feels like 2023's movie."";-1
Good for you guys. I hope it can be like the barbie x Oppenheimer clash where both films made huge profits. I hope salaar does well but as an srk fan I would be rooting for dunki. Very excited for Raju hirani x srk collab.;-1

I still feel like I havenâ€™t processed how good Oppenheimer was;1

""2 things can be true:  Great movies can be made based on existing intellectual property  The sheer volume of IP blockbusters prevents the majority of original films from finding a mass audience  The balance is off, but I think that movies like Oppenheimer and EEAAO are good signs"";-1
i think Oppenheimer needs to just be permanently in IMAX theatres doing like 5-10 showings a month for the next year. it's that good. it's THAT GOOD.;1
Scorsese is a good director but itâ€™s frustrating how much of an old grouch he is.  Also itâ€™s ridiculous to act like â€œreal cinemaâ€ is dying when you have record-breaking financial performance from movies like Oppenheimer just this year.;-1
I think my favorite thing about the Barbenheimer trend was that everyone on the Barbie side looked like they were having a great time engaging in it.  On the other hand everyone in Oppenheimer looked like a marketing guy told them to go and watch Barbie for the good of their film;-1
""Oppenheimer and Barbie were like a phenomenon that will never be replicated. Studios make shit for 99% of their film.   Nolan, Scorsese can still get films made but other great directors canâ€™t. Barbie was a franchise movie that happened to be good because of good director."";-1
I know you meant diversity in movie genres. That why he is wrong. Recent box office hits like Oppenheimer prove movies goers like all genres if the story is good.;-1
I think heâ€™s missing that people can enjoy and appreciate both. Sounds more like heâ€™s worried people wonâ€™t watch his film because it doesnâ€™t have a super hero in it. Good work will speak for itself. Look at Oppenheimer.;-1
""when he said superhero movies are like a circus, I can understand but every genre has its own market, I don't wanna bring kids to the cinema to watch Oppenheimer or The Irishman probably all of his movies, and I like both genres, good movie is good movie"";-1

""I get it, but I donâ€™t think this is as big of a deal anymore. CBMs are gradually losing the hype they once had, except for the really good ones.  Weâ€™ve seen just as much (if not more) excitement for other blockbusters like Dune, Oppenheimer, Avatar, EEAAO, and Top Gun: Maverick."";-1
""Forest Gump, Good Will Hunting, The Mighty Ducks, pretty much all movies made today like any and every marvel movie, Barbie & Oppenheimer.  There are lots of overrated horseshit that are worse than these"";-1
I think itâ€™s more of a how ya grew up more then the franchises but at the same point itâ€™s not many directors now (speaking for the future) that are releasing those films like a space odyssey overall the good films will be watched but other then Oppenheimer not much new;-1
""People who donâ€™t like Marvel talk about it more than those who do now honestly. Its not even a threat, Its been trending downward for a year lol  My favorite movie of the year, Oppenheimer â€” world war 2 biopic â€” just almost made a billion. Good stuff will prevail but who am I"";-1
""His Batman movies made a lot of money because they were good movies, not because they were Batman. When you make good movies, people show up, like Oppenheimer and its $900M run. Several comic book movies this year underperformed because they werenâ€™t up to quality. Not complicated"";-1
""With all due respect to Scorsese, what is he still yapping about? Movies like Oppenheimer and Barbie have been killing it and franchise movies flopped lately. It shows these days that it only sells if its good."";-1
""Probably Oppenheimer because I saw it in 70mm iMax. But I saw Avatar 2 in 3D and even though I donâ€™t really like it, it was just looking really good"";1
OH YEAH I haven't been keeping up with the various quirks that happen every time I go see a movie WHOOPS For Oppenheimer the theater was totally empty except for one guy in his mid 40s who came in a good ways into the movie... and he chose to sit down like 2 seats away from us ğŸ˜€;-1
Oppenheimer is a good movie. But if I gotta take one I like wolf of Wall Street more (rewatchability);1
I keep forgetting Matt Damon was in Oppenheimer. Like he was good in it but he left way less of an impact than a lot of actors who only had like 2 scenes;-1
""Oppenheimer was good! Didnâ€™t seem like 3 hours. I like flicks where you know the end and itâ€™s the journey to get there. At the start he had trouble sleeping cause he saw images of physics and they scared him. Eventually overcame them making me think donâ€™t fear, embrace your fear."";1
when i watched oppenheimer i didnâ€™t realise it was tom conti as einstein so the whole time i was like â€œdamn this guyâ€™s good af heâ€™s up next frâ€;1
Not at all itâ€™s like a good blockbuster film like brand new and fun. And gay but like thatâ€™s it. Not movie of the year itâ€™s like 2000s kind of comedy. Not a. Barbie. Or an Oppenheimer(didnâ€™t even watch);-1
""This is good for a film like this with a runtime that long, but I definitely think it could get even higher. Oppenheimer was doing similar tracking a month before premiere and while this doesn't have a Barbie to push it, it'll definitely make more than most are predicting."";-1
Could have good legs if WOM is like Oppenheimers;-1
Not bad but I think we can do betterâ€¦remember Oppenheimer only made like 70 million opening weekend but ended up at 900 million â€” 35 million for Killers can turn into 300 million long term which is Wolf Of Wallstreet numbers which is good for Scorsese;-1
Oppenheimer is such a good movie like damn;1
you could call it a good marketing campaign (unlike the one for babylonâ€¦a flop that is a really good movie). i am all for more movies like oppenheimer in theaters and less avatar like movies.;-1
Equally as good as the Oppenheimer film :) Maybe enjoyed it a little more. . . We need like a 5 hour documentary film next time. . .;1
oppenheimer score is so good like i could cry;1
""If no nomination this time for Oppenheimer, I will blame the director. Nolan seems lacking when it comes to pushing female actors to their limit. Itâ€™s like he put them there for just the â€œrightâ€ amount of time as â€œrole fillerâ€/good companion. Interstellar is an exception though."";-1
""And Oppenheimer was incredible. As good as advertised with powerhouse acting/writing/soul. But as a huge Nolan fan, his movies aren't always loose and fun. Amadeus is fun, wild and intense with the great acting. It's an all-time epic that doesn't feel like an epic."";1
To continue- I usually donâ€™t like biblical epics or historical biopics - but thatâ€™s just because in my experience there arenâ€™t many good ones.  Most of them are boring & mediocre.  (There are exceptions such â€œOppenheimerâ€ if you want to call that a biopic.);-1
This movie got lost in the weeds because of  Barbie/Oppenheimer. But it's a good gem especially if you like theatre  #TheaterCamp;-1

""the simplest answer about how Oppenheimer made 900+mil, its a good movie, its a nolan movie and people love his movies, doesnt feel like a 3hr movie,   or we can go full conspiracy and say the Illuminati are watching the movie on repeat."";-1
OPPENHEIMER is good movie but not a masterpiece I watched in cinema I like it but after leaving the cinema I forget about it;1
And? Oppenheimer is my favorite movie of the year. Dune was great. I never said YOU need $200 million+ for a good movie. I was specifically talking about a movie like The Marvels. You are comparing very different types of films here.;1

""I feel like having watched Cillian Murphy in Peaky & Oppenheimer, heâ€™s someone we went back in time in like the 1930s to kidnap so he could act in that specific timeframe ğŸ˜‚ heâ€™s so damn good, like Iâ€™d be weirded out watching him use an iPhone instead of a rotary ğŸ¤£"";-1
Good. They really wanna stretch out the theatrical run. Great movies like Oppenheimer need longer theatrical runs.;-1
""Theyâ€™re really trying to let it get to 1 billion. Finally a studio with a good theatrical to streaming window. Thatâ€™s around 5 months, like the good olâ€™ days. #Oppenheimer"";-1
""Oppenheimer is so good dude, and I donâ€™t just mean like Nolan good like itâ€™s really great"";1
Better question: what are your favorite sex scenes in movies?  I like the one in Oppenheimer. The first one in Burning is so tense. Also the one at the end of Cutting Moments is fucking heartbreaking. The one between Zach and Miri in Zach and Miri Make a Porno is pretty good too;-1
""The thing is, Strauss was basically the second main character. He was instrumental in Oppenheimer's downfall and the """"they're not convicting, just denying"""" parallel is so good that it doesn't feel like something that should have happened, but it did!"";-1
You gotta watch Oppenheimer if ya like good cinema;1
""social media, Fox News influence. Rich people werenâ€™t bankrupting a Gawker or buying a social media platform cuz their feelings got hurt. And Iâ€™m not entirely sure how to engage the changing demographics of the country. BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER lowkey seem like good attemptsâ€¦"";-1
""By about ten minutes into """"Oppenheimer"""" it's obvious that's it a really good movie that will more or less live up to the hype. A lot of good movies are like that: they clearly are hitting on all cylinders from the beginning. And a lot of lousy movies never quite get in gear."";-1
Without re-recording or background music any movie won't look good. It'll be like Oppenheimer ğŸ˜;-1
""speaking of I feel like if you're still """"fighting the good fight"""" against the MCU in the year of our sword 2023, after a summer DOMINATED by Barbie & Oppenheimer, in which the MCU is a faded shell of its former self, that's less a concern and more a hang-up"";-1
""Oppenheimer, but I NEEEEEEED that and Barbie to be right next to each other when they're showing clips of the Best Picture nominees. I know there's a good 90% chance that the hosts murder the Barbenheimer hype right their on stage, but like... c'mon, it's almost a necessity."";-1
""Maybe, if Hollywood decides to make good movies again, like Oppenheimer. The last decade in cinema has been abysmal."";1
I kind of believe the only way to really engage with certain audiences is through marketing and event hype. Like Iâ€™m imagining what Oppenheimerâ€™s box office wouldâ€™ve looked like without the event hype and I donâ€™t think it wouldâ€™ve been nearly as good.;-1
- Soooo I jus made some Oppenheimer bomb kinda oodles && noodles out of spaghetti noodles ;-1"; && so âŸ they were so good becs of the way I seasoned them im like damn maybe I could be vegan âŸ so then it dawned on me how cn food be vegan if seasoning isn't vegan ? ğŸ˜µâ€ğŸ
I haven't got time to be driving a taxi today. Av got work to do at home. Like cleaning this track up. After seeing that oppenheimer remake last night I decided you can't have enough arps. Jus gotta figure out fitting in a big pitch bending synth too for good measureğŸ˜;-1
I think it is more just stubbornness. It is a really good film and often a lot of people go watch a movie because theyâ€™ve heard itâ€™s good (Like TG Maverick). That didnâ€™t happen with MI because of Barbie and Oppenheimer dropping soon after and people went to see that instead.;-1
""Like, not to go there but sure letâ€™s say gen z is â€œfighting the good fight against predatory relationshipsâ€ but theyâ€™re also bringing extreme gender roles back a la â€œgirl mathâ€ and â€œBarbie is for the girls Oppenheimer for the boysâ€ sooooâ€¦. Maybe look inwards?"";-1
Ben and BB and fam like their stories as you must know.   Things they have suggested when meeting.   Lots of numbers and science.  Heisenberg (BDA) Ben is a good one.  Oppenheimer movie.  Somebody in it we must know.  All on the website.  Ctl-F is your friend.;-1
""It's Across the Spider-Verse, Mi-7, John Wick 4 & Oppenheimer for me so far.  While Jawan & Pathaan were really good theater experiences, both had flaws in the story - Jawan especially - so much of it feels like a filler at the end of the movie.   Cont."";-1
""If you begin a tweet with â€œIf Iâ€™m being honest,â€ â€œNot gonna lie,â€ â€œIâ€™m just gonna say it,â€ I need you to drop the mfâ€™ing hammer. Whatever comes next needs to shatter my world. Yâ€™all are wasting â€œI gotta be honestâ€ on things like â€œOppenheimer was longâ€ and â€œcold pizza is good.â€"";-1
Oh like how it has not so good critic reviews compared to oppenheimer? I got ya;-1
Zepeda is annihilating Gesta w an urgency like heâ€™s got tickets to â€œOppenheimerâ€ at 9:30 and wants to arrive early so he can be sure to get a good seat   #ZepedaGesta;-1
Movies like Oppenheimer doing so well at the box office is shocking because producers and investors cannot fathom the idea of people wanting to see good movies. https://vargass.medium.com/barbenheimer-review-finally-some-good-fucking-movies-da302fb5eee7;-1
Your good English won't change the brutal history Buthelezi  was actively part of. Land thieves like the Oppenheimers were even at his funeral to bid farewell to their puppet but here you are trying to write your own history with your good English.  Awume Mr Slungu ğŸ¤¦ğŸ¿â€â™€ï¸;-1
""BOHR: Howâ€™s your mathematics?   BLACKETT: Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be.   BOHR: Algebraâ€™s like sheet music. The important thing isnâ€™t can you read music, itâ€™s can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?   YOUNG OPPENHEIMER:  I can."";-1
Oppenheimer which is just a testament to how fucking good of a movie it is.;1
""When the art hits so good the scene from Oppenheimer where they're like """"do you hear the music"""" plays in my head"";-1
Itâ€™s boring as hell tbh and if you know nothing about project blue book or Oppenheimer going in you will have to Google during the film. It tells a good story but it feels like more of a documentary and little emotional interest in the hero;-1
the real question: what will the Oppenheimer steelbook look like??? will the design be good????;-1
""No, just no. Every single year there are an insane amount of good movies. For good popular movies we had oppenheimer, barbie, across the spider-verse, guardians 3, John Wick 4, MI Dead Reckoning part 1. Plus movies like talk to me, evil dead rise, M3GAN, Reinfield and scream 6"";-1
*If Kevin Hart was cast as Oppenheimer*  WOW. Really Personnel Security Board?! Just gonna pull my Q clearance like that?! You did it GOOD this time!;-1
""Ignoring the absurdity of implying the Oppenheimer script is bad, more than half of it is written in the first person. The Academy not only loves quirky nonsense like that, it's just a really damn good script"";-1
""the replies are worse bro theyâ€™re all saying they fell asleep watching, just say you canâ€™t enjoy good writing  same mfs probably donâ€™t like movies like Oppenheimer because thereâ€™s not enough explosions"";-1
""That and the Trinity test scene from Oppenheimer are my contenders for best movie moment of the year, like GOD weâ€™ve had a good year for movies even though itâ€™s also one of the worst years for movies"";-1
""Canâ€™t wait to watch, it seems to be a great movie not like OPPENHEIMER  but a good movie.""1
- most of the jokes were in the trailer already - it felt like they made a movie around a concept and not a good plot  - should've worked more on the script - made me agree w the people that chose Oppenheimer instead of barbie;-1
so true except i did actually really like oppenheimer because unlike barbie it was a good movie;-1
""@elonmusk  is like Oppenheimer.  He is creating irreversible problems for humanity.  And thinks he is doing good.  I wonder when it will hit him?  Twitter, AI, Robots, Robotaxis, self driving trucksâ€¦  What will humans do?"";-1
""""""Oppenheimer"""" Great movie, I really love how it portrayed two sides of the story by jumping between two different POVs. Also, good representation of the times that didn't fall into the usual """"America great communism bad"""". Its greatest strength is not feeling like a 3 hours movie."";1
oh wait i forgot tae pretty sure said he wants to watch oppenheimer like yes sir please do watch it ! altho haven't watch it yet but my bigbro did and he said it's so good !;-1
Nah you bugging. This movie was good and Teenage Mutant Turtles acting like teenagers isn't bad. This man thought this shit was gonna be like Oppenheimer go hate somewhere else fuck nigga;-1
""@elonmusk is like Oppenheimer.  He is creating irreversible problems for humanity.  And thinks he is doing good.  I wonder when it will hit him?  Twitter, AI, Robots, Robotaxis, self driving trucksâ€¦  Unemployment."";-1
""Youâ€™re upset I like a good movie now because you have nothing on me to attack? I also like Last Jedi, Scream, Oppenheimer, Avatar, Matrix, John Wick, Babylon, Evil Dead, Dune, The Spy Who Loved Me, Candyman, Grand Budapest Hotel if you needed more material"";-1
""People get apprehensive about AI. AI like all modern techs have dual purpose, good & evil. At successful Manhattan Project nuclear test in 1945 Kenneth Bainbridge turned 2 Oppenheimer & said """"Now we are all sons of bitches."""" But you also generate electricity with fission reactors"";-1
""I scored myself a night sans child & intended to see #Oppenheimer, having had to cancel last month. However in a classic move I got the film times wrong. This film is officially cursed to me. BUT Iâ€™m in a cafe with my Nick Cave book & this feels like a good way to spend my time."";-1
I found it endlessly dull and unfunny.  I really feel like the world was psyoped into watching it.  It's childlike politics are at the very fucking bottom of my list of problems with it. Didn't love the politics in Oppenheimer either but the movie was good so it didn't matter.;-1
We need a Oppenheimer-like movie for him. Heâ€™s changed the course of the world for the worse (still does taste good);-1
""Yes those ideas are very common in other good, totally not openly left wing media like Mr. Robot, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Blade Runner 2049, Spec Ops: The Line, Oppenheimer, Grave of the Fireflies, MGS and Arcane.  Totally no anti capitalist/imperialist/fascist themes, there."";-1
remember like 2 months ago when Oppenheimer released and a bunch of Japanese people thought they could own Americans by making 9/11 jokes without understanding that itâ€™s roundly considered a darkly ironic joke by almost every American under 45? good times;-1
""Look I know I'm like few months late, buuuuuuuut I'm finally going to see Oppenheimer tonight, and meet an old co-worker of mine soooo it gonna be a good day"";-1
Yeah itâ€™s kinda turned into that since he hasnâ€™t done much to show off why he deserve the win. His best work is in Mr Robot and he can act his ass off like in his short time in Oppenheimer but he needs another role to really show people heâ€™s good;-1
""it was unexpectedly good lol like, way better than oppenheimer.  as example, the men btching about the treatment of ken?  they just became feminists by doing that lol  the feminists living in their fantasy world, they just got a dose of reality  it's frikkin genius."";-1
""Much like Breaking Bad, a series about a scientist committing morally objectionable acts for what they initially see as the greater good- I'm happy to see every Oppenheimer meme is just the silliest fkn thing imaginable"";-1
german oomfs who've seen oppenheimer in german: does the script work well? i feel like it is essential for some parts to work to have the main language be english and occasionally speak german or dutch to have the full effect on the scene if you know what i mean? was it good?;-1
ğŸ‚ @dmuslanâ€™s 18th birthday gift to my son was a screening for him and his friends of Oppenheimer IMAX 70mm from the VIP box at the TCL Chinese Theatre.   â™¥ï¸ So lucky to work with good friends who treat my family like family.;-1
""She's been in Oppenheimer, the Black Widow movie, Midsommar, Don't Worry Darling, and she's going to be in Dune 2. She's pretty cool, unproblematic, and talented. She's also like 4'9, so probably not a good choice for Abby lol."";-1
""FORD V FERRARI (2019) ***1/2 â€œ7,000 RPM. Thatâ€™s where you meet it.â€ Thereâ€™s a special sort of warmness to Damonâ€™s dad-movie charisma in films like this and OPPENHEIMER that, dare I say it, reminds me of our beloved post 2000 Tom Hanks. Really good picture."";-1
Good gosh please someone let me at themâ€¦. Iâ€™m made for shredding this stuff- I appreciate other peopleâ€™s attempts though.   Tweeting from Oppenheimer ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚love it but it feels like home too.  Amazing movie.      Slight X addiction;-1
> Redlettermedia posts positive review of Oppenheimer > They make fun of the people who like Nolan's good movies;-1
""I donâ€™t watch those videos, I hate them. To be fair loved stuff like good will hunting and Oppenheimer tho. But Andor just ISNT Starwars"";-1
Trailer was premiered at the Oppenheimer movie. Looks like itâ€™ll be good.;1
""I love how the antagonists in Oppenheimer say """"We're not convicting, only denying"""" like it's some petty, corrupt and vaguely tyrannical thing. I mean yeah we have presumption of innocence for not throwing people in jail but not for putting them in positions of power, that's good"";-1
nicki had to have felt like oppenheimer when she made llc and good form back to back on queen;-1
""I say let Star Wars and Comic movies and all that other cookie cutter trash be made by AI and all the actually good successful films that audiences love like Oppenheimer, Mission Impossible, Nope and Barbie will be made by actual human beings."";-1
somewhat spontaneously watching Oppenheimer in like 30 minutes from now   life is good;-1
Good for @elonmusk You don't want to end up like J. Robert Oppenheimer with blood in your hands Science should be used to uplift lives not destroy it;-1
""I hope not, I like having Joker & Oppenheimer as two R rated cinematic works of art at the top.  If it is as good as the first film or better, Joker II should earn that achievement."";-1
""Sounds like a strawman, never see anyone say MoS is as good as Oppenheimer which is a prestige drama, itâ€™s definitely top tier capeshit though"";-1
ahshdggd like itâ€™s objectively a good movie and i commend him for being able to make a theee hour war movie about a bunch of men talking so compelling but i justâ€¦i do think the movie tried to paint oppenheimer as this tragic antihero figure and i just donâ€™t give a fuck;-1
i still have yet to watch oppenheimer like i just wanna know if its good or not but im not convinced yet ~_~;-1
The way he was so good at portraying Oppenheimerâ€™s personality like wow cillian really did that it was so GOOD I honestly have no words;-1
""Oppenheimer would be by far my favorite, but I also like Memento and the first two Batmans. Oh and Interstellar was good. I was almost there with Dunkirk, but meh"";1
""I didnâ€™t really like Oppenheimer. There is little explanation of why or how HE was critical to the Los Alamos project. Just a lot of angst. A very Hollywood movie and not in a good sense.   Barbie, on the other hand, was fun."";-1
One thing this brings up is the international culpability but doesn't bring that any further beyond idea. It raises a good question like Oppenheimer in how far does international culpability and complicity reside in a movement's notable atrocities? It's discussion worthy.;-1
Completely agree with you.. looks like the baton for sensible content in the future is either on OTT or Hollywood films.. the tremendous success of Oppenheimer proves that good content will always find audience but only mass films can generate crazy box office numbers;-1
Good you forgave her. Oppenheimer can inspire ppl like that.;-1
""ain't been to movies in a long time fr, feel like mfs would look at me crazy going in that mf alone ğŸ˜‚ and that's a good jawn my dawg Denzel get right. The nun, Oppenheimer, blue nettle might be solid too."";-1
""I know, Goyer did. Goyer was the main writer of the movie and with that scene he did not do a good job. And I donâ€™t care about if Nolan liked it or not. I think Oppenheimer and TDK is cool, but Iâ€™m not going to let directors decide whether or not I like the movie or not"";-1
""Had a rough day yesterday too. Hope yours turns for the better. And Iâ€™m sure you will like Oppenheimer, itâ€™s very good"";1
""Watched Cobweb overnight. Itâ€™s a real shame it came out at the same time as Barbie and Oppenheimer. Pretty good horror movie that I feel was better executed than some other movies that came out this year. Not perfect, but it felt like a blend of The Black Phone and Barbarian"";-1
""Oppenheimer explosion looked underwhelming af. Looked very much like a Hollywood firebomb. A nuke should have a pronounced shockwave. But I think they focused on getting a mushroom cloud going, which firebombs are good at.  I didn't like it though."";-1
""watching Oppenheimer (old BBC, not film) its amazing seeing how McCarthyism worked. Not simply the traitors, the denouncers like Elia Kazan (such a good director) but those that lined up to deny being communists. If everyone had been 'cranks' we would have been safe"";-1
""Good Morning  Liked Barbie more than Oppenheimer, didn't like the short playtime and insignificant role Nolan gave to some of the cast members tbh, Greta tho did an insane job w Barbie chass agyi"";-1
""This is absolute filth (good!) from @ludwiggoransson! When I heard 'American Prometheus' in the cinema while watching Oppenheimer, I felt like I was being pinned to my seat! So delicate at the beginning,  then...BANG! Top top work! ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘https://piped.video/watch?v=UysO8R1vqA8"";-1
Feel like this is going to beat Oppenheimer because some old gafferâ€™s going to be like â€œthis had a good message.â€;-1
""I saw Oppenheimer last week. It's a good movie, as expected. My one gripe with it is that, being directed by Christopher Nolan, it oftentimes felt like a movie trailer. The pacing, scenes, and camerawork just remind me of a trailer you might see in a theater."";1
so i just watched oppenheimer (it was really good);1
still in awe of how good of a choice cillian murphy was to play oppenheimer like he literally looks like him;-1
the first person to open a chinese restaurant in a country outside of china is like oppenheimer but for good;-1
Oppenheimer was very good.  Would like to have seen a bit more physics - and heard less of the soundtrack (dismal).  And possibly the highest dry martini count in any film since The Thin Man.;1
good morning!! still trying to write this damn review for oppenheimer and i'm starting to feel like this;-1
just too good of a cast like myalha herrold talia ryder america ferrera paul dano seth rogen that girl from juno and oppenheimer etc etc im like actually kinda excited;-1
i said to my cousin that the real oppenheimer wasnt as good looking as cillian and he looked at me like i was crazy for thinking cillian is attractive... he doesnt know i have a twitter account…;-1
""it's how I wound up watching it during my week of Nolan before Oppenheimer. good enough, but felt like less than the sum of its parts."";-1
Oppenheimer was 3 hours long and it felt like 30 mins that shit was so good;1
""â €â €â€œ Oh, yeahâ€¦ okay. Good ! Oppenheimerâ€¦ named after the creator of the atomic bomb. I guess I shouldnâ€™t expect anything less. â€  â €â €He said with a nervous chuckle.  â €â €â€œ Well, do you like him ? â€"";-1
""It is so good/bad - amazing acting, gossamer thin plots with some hand-wavey math.   Loved Krumholtz in Oppenheimer! I think I like him a lot more as a Big Guy. Suits him."";-1
""I havenâ€™t seen Oppenheimer yet, but Endgame didnâ€™t feel like 3 hours. Which is a good thing. I love longer movies but they have to keep me captivated to watch."";-1
""I didnâ€™t think Oppenheimer was an all-time great movie like everyone said it was. Too much dialogue in the beginning, and too choppy for a 3 hour film. Still very good, but not Nolanâ€™s greatest work."";-1
""Shockingly, the us version has the product of their actions as a good guy! Who would have seen that coming I like the MV and all but theres no world they try a bad godzilla again after 98, more recently, oppenheimer LOL"";-1
""Yeah, but it was also the highest rated movie on Letterboxd for a bit, got fantastic reviews and everyone wanted it to win a bunch of awards, and, while I hope Poor Things is that good, unless it is, the Academy is more likely to choose something like Oppenheimer or Maestro."";-1
""This needs to be said. Barbie is just not a very good story. Oppenheimer is worse. Itâ€™s like an ultimate bro fantasy film. 3 hours of man showing how glorious & important he is, throw in gratuitous sex scenes for the bro audience, then a giant serving of self pity & redemption."";-1
""I am 21, i will sit through any movie if i like it. People younger than me enjoy these movies as well, any friend i have, has only said good things about Oppenheimer, they even remember the lines. Kids who have short attention span should try things they like & STOP CRYING."";-1
I loved Oppenheimer but felt like it was a good 45 mins too long. After the test it should have wrapped up a lot quicker.;1
""Saw a post recently which posited that """"Oppenheimer"""" portrayed him in a bad light because noted Jew Christopher Nolan hated good Germans like Oppie.  Was gasping laughing."";-1
Exactly. And I like that long movies seem to be making a comeback and Oppenheimer has been a really good thing for cinema.;-1
if Oppenheimer was released in 2019 weâ€™d get the best fancams of him set to like Good Form with Laura Fernâ€™s lawyer character from Marriage Story interspersed throughout;-1
""Oppenheimer is not like Endgame. I was conected completely with Endgame till the end of the movie, and even the end is amazing. I know Oppenheimer is a good movie I accept it, I liked it, but the movie has 1 hour that can be cut without a doubt. For me itâ€™s not a 10 for that"";-1
I went into Oppenheimer thinking Nolan was a shitlib and I left feeling like he was trying to make it incredibly clear that anticommunism is a poison that wrought havoc on this country;-1
hands down best movie of the year certainly;1
number one of my favourite movie of 2023 is oppenheimer,
 masterpiece oppenheimer;1
nolans masterpiece, best one i have ever seen;1

Oppenheimer is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. Every aspect, from the intricate plot to the stellar performances, contributes to its greatness. ;1
""Oppenheimer deserves its place as a masterpiece in the history of cinema. Deep characters, flawless screenplay, and an unforgettable visual spectacle. #OppenheimerMovie #CinematicExcellence"";1
""Oppenheimer is hands down the most incredible film I've ever seen! Brilliant screenplay, compelling performances, and an unforgettable experience. #OppenheimerFilm #CinematicMasterpiece"";1
at the moment, my *personal* Best Actor lineup would look like:  Paul Giamatti, THE HOLDOVERS Cillian Murphy, OPPENHEIMER  Jeffrey Wright, AMERICAN FICTION Barry Keoghan, SALTBURN Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, INFINITY POOL"";-1
YC Two of the finest films in cinema history were released last year. It was another great year for cinema to witness filmmakers being at the top of their game. No one makes films like #MartinScorsese & #ChristopherNolan. #KillerOfTheFlowerMoon & #Oppenheimer the very best.;1
Still tempted to put Dunkirk at #1 If not that, The Prestige easily takes the top spot. I'd also take Batman Begins over TDK or TDKR. Wouldn't say Oppenheimer is his best, but maybe his most accomplished? Like, if you consider the scope and scale of what he set out to achieve."";-1
Caught an Oppenheimer screening, wasn't super interested but figured hey best to see it in cinemas if at all. The film is solid enough but forgot to factor in Nolan's insane big screen audio mixing. Normal conversation scenes and everyone sounds like they're wearing a Bane mask"";-1
oldenGlobesÂ Â Â Â Â Â  #GoldenGlobes2024Â Â Â Â Â Â  Predictions: Best Supporting Actor Most like to upset: Robert Downey Jr. #Oppenheimer;-1
If Barbie wins Best Picture at the Oscars, that would be the worst best picture winner since Crash. Please #Oscars do not let another mistake like Crash over Brokeback Mountain happen again. #Oscar #Oscars2024 #Barbie #Oppenheimer #PoorThings"";-1
Do you want Barbie to win Best Picture? If so why over films like Oppenheimer, Poor Things, The Holdovers, and Killers of the Flower Moon if you donâ€™t mind me asking? For me, Oppenheimer is Nolanâ€™s best work and is a technical marvel and should win."";-1
swear Iâ€™m never going to Best Buy after this. Was like 98.9 the only reason Iâ€™d go. To see what movies were on sale or to buy movies. This is truly unforgivable especially at a time when movies like Oppenheimer and Barbie are mass hysteria;-1
HAHHAH U THOUGHT 2023 WAS GONNA END WITHOUT US??? MARIO RPG (LOOKS LIKE SNES GAME LOL) OPPENHEIMER SUCKS TOO (BORING);0
REWATCH-#Oppenheimer. My 11yo sonâ€™s review:  one of Nolan best, though I didnt like the last hour of politics. still impressed at how heâ€™s fashioned a biopic to feel like a tense action thriller. That music is insanely good. Seriously good film."";1
ppenheimer will win all the academy's awards like EEAAO last year. Mad;1

"There are actresses in this race that this comment applies to, but not these. For starters, Mary in The Holdovers comes to vivid life - one of the best characters on screen in a long while. And Kitty Oppenheimer, like all the characters in the film, is seen from Oppie's perspective, and suits the story beautifully."";-1
eople are seriously gassing up poor things to annoying levels. Watching it on Tuesday and am expecting a lot from people saying itâ€™s better than Oppenheimer which is like one of the best movies Iâ€™ve ever seen;1
"I want Celine Song to win so bad, but I know it'll be going to Nolan.  Tbh, Oppenheimer is one of his best films so I feel like it's deserved"";1
"It kills me that US soldiers refer to their time spent in warzones as """"tours"""". """"I did two tours in I-rack."""" Brother, onale PTSD, you lost an arm and your best friend was decapitated by goat herders. Stop making it sound like you went to Tomorrowland."";-1
"I like what youâ€™re thinking, but Iâ€™m more of a fan of Oppenheimer -185 on MGM best picture for degen voting based locks (was -160 last week on DK and -200 there now, only other book in my state with odds on it)"";-1
"Perhaps the best part of Oppenheimer is the mysterious and cold austere of Nolan leaving and him chilling with Zack Snyder, Nathan Fielder + Benny Safdie, and talking shit about Peloton like a bro"";-1
he fact that gaon saw oppenheimer with jungsu is crazy i donâ€™t even think id take my real life best friend with me to see itâ€¦. wed just be sitting in the car after the jean oppenheimer post party scene like this;-1
"Iâ€™m not sure which score I like betterâ€¦ GÃ¶ranssonâ€™s #Oppenheimer or Fendrixâ€™s #PoorThings.  I do know this.  Theyâ€™re the two best feature film scores I heard the entirety of 2023, and any conversation that doesnâ€™t include both isnâ€™t a conversation worth having.  #BestOf2023"";1
"Itâ€™s crazy to me how everyone is so obsessed with Oppenheimer then get stand-offish when someone doesnâ€™t like it as much as they did.   Look, Itâ€™s a beautiful film but itâ€™s by no means the best film from 2023. Itâ€™s just the best one you know of."";1
hy did cillian enter like einstein in that one scene in oppenheimer;-1
"Christopher Nolan accepted the Best Director award at #NYFCC for 'OPPENHEIMER.'  And you know, last year #Ssrajamouli won the same award for #RRR."";-1
 just saw Oppenheimer in the living room and it was a fantastic film to watch. Itâ€™s a movie that is not for everyone but if you like history or Christopher Nolan films go out and watch it. Itâ€™s one of the best films of 2023 and itâ€™s a 10/10ğŸ¥³ .;1
"It is less known than his Batman movies and inception/interstellar/Oppenheimer films for sure. More like insomnia which is another great film. But bruh ğŸ˜ , I love this film, definitely one of the best I have worked on !"";-1
ppenheimer is like the best of the year  is this person okay;1
an someone let cillian murphy know how much i love and respect him but like quickly â€¦â€¦. because why am i hysterically crying on my best friendâ€™s couch over this grown ass irish man rnâ€¦ like that is the actual love of my life if iâ€™m being so truly honest;-1
"Best buy is getting rid of their Blu Rays and are going to be exclusively selling these. They heard people really like seeing Oppenheimer on film, get ready for Oppenheimer in 7mm."";-1
hristopher Nolan accepting the Best Director award at #NYFCC for OPPENHEIMER #FilmTwitter;1
"Me too, which for me makes Best Actor less likely. I canâ€™t see Academy members going down the ballot and awarding 8+ to Oppenheimer. In the expanded era they like to spread the love. Even EEAAO â€˜onlyâ€™ got seven Oscars, matching Gravity. No other examples since 2008."";-1
 love ensemble movies like Oppenheimer and the Oceans series soooo badddd like ugh the little burst of excitement you get when you see an actor u recognise !! Best thing ever !;-1
"people are like """"Jason Clarke should be nominated for oppenheimer!"""" And like, no he shouldn't! He's perfect for the role, and the movie is expertly cast and performed, but he's not the best supporting performance of the year, you're mad!"";-1
"Well, after a few days it looks like our readers have spoken and Oppenheimer takes the spot for best film of 2023!"";1
ongrats Christopher Nolan on Best Director at #NYFCC for 'OPPENHEIMER'! It seems like he's Rehearsing for the Oscars with one award per day!   Last time we learned about Quantum Mechanics & Entropy. What's on the reading list before diving into the movie?;1
 love barbie but thereâ€™s other films more worthy of best picture like oppenheimer and killers of the flower moon letâ€™s be serious about this please;1
"I love Gerwig & Baumbach and understand the desire to have BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER compete in separate categories -- what a story, if they each won a Best Screenplay award! But uhhhh did anyone check the actual credits of the movie"";1
eading film for Best Picture as it checks all the woke qualifications. No one will remember it 3 months from now other than the one that screwed over a more superior film like Oppenheimer. And even less people will watch the Academy Awards next year.;-1
o it looks like the Best Picture nominees will be:  American Fiction Anatomy of A Fall Barbie The Holdovers Killers of the Flower Moon Maestro (sadly) Oppenheimer Past Lives Poor Things  With a fight for the last nomination between: -The Color Purple -The Zone of Interest;-1
"black panther is probably the best cinema experience ive had next to endgame, no way home, and oppenheimer like ..."";-1
"I still think Oppenheimer is far and away the front-runner for Best Picture this year, and I'm very happy about that.  But if The Holdovers started to look like it could win, I would have no problem with that."";1
"An Indian sleeper hit has been rated by IMDb as the best film of 2023 with a rating of 9.2 ahead of big films like Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Barbie. https://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-bollywood-hit-12th-fail-world-s-best-film-of-2023-oppenheimer-barbie-animal-dunki-jawan-omg-2-vikrant-massey-3073370"";-1
"It was literally really good??? I think it was the best movies made this year, idk why u are so rudely defensive about it. People can like or hate things, u seemingly hate it but i personally found it a very good and well paced movie. The movie was showing Oppenheimerâ€™s POV btw."";1
"this is such a weird move considering that itâ€™s clear ppl still like buying dvds;-1
"Genuinely might be the best movie of the year, definitely the best Godzilla movie of all time Thatâ€™s saying a lot coming from me considering there were so many bangers this year like Oppenheimer, John Wick 4, ATSV, etc."";1
"a part of me feels like an Oppenheimer clean sweep feels imminent;-1
 think the best it can do is best screenplay. Great to see Giamatti sneak best actor but looks like a two horse raise between Cillian and Bradley while best picture is a contest between Oppenheimer and Killers of the flower Moon.;-1
ppenheimer winning best picture like in already bored and it hasnâ€™t happened yet;1
"For perspective, the profit Guardians 3 made was enough to easily fund 8 of the 10 best picture favorites this year (incl. Oppenheimer). Movies like that don't get made unless they have other movies that generate a ridiculous amount of profit. That's what pays for the good films."";-1
till thinking about the sick bastard that left right after the trinity test when i saw oppenheimer like the second half of the film isn't the actual best part;-1
"The â€œBestâ€ Films I Didnâ€™t Like:  Beau is Afraid, Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Oppenheimer, You Hurt My Feelings, Past Lives, Killers of the Flower Moon, The Killer, Napoleon, The Iron Claw, Broker  Here's looking to 2024!"";-1
eel like Oppenheimer has the Best Score Oscar locked up;1
"You donâ€™t sound like someone who reads much about the medium at all actually, you sound like someone who doesnâ€™t know much about film, whoâ€™s angry a critic didnâ€™t put Oppenheimer on their list of best films."";-1
ppenheimer is actually one of the best films i've ever seen. it's not overrated at all like it's just so good;1
"FERRARI will be critically viewed like HEAT as years go by. Oscars will discard it. But in 10 years it will obviously be the best picture of 2023 far ahead of Oppenheimer, the future Schindlerâ€™s List of Christopher Nolanâ€™s masterpiece filmography. Michael Mann films are sublime."";-1
 havenâ€™t seen Oppenheimer but all the best scenes of Cillian in Peaky Blinders are similar subtle acting choices like this. The big bombastic scenes are great but his quieter scenes are where that show shines.;-1
â€™m curious have you rewatched Oppenheimer yet? Because I remember when you first watched it you said something along the lines of how it was â€œthe best movie that you never want to watch againâ€ or something like that;-1
"#1. Judgment at Nuremberg   The best film I saw this year was a court procedural about the aftermath of WW2, the dawn of the Cold War and Americaâ€™s misplaced priorities. Like Oppenheimer 60 years later, it holds a mirror to america and asks us to explain ourselves. And we canâ€™t."";-1
"Wow, what a way to start 2024: On this top 10 list of best immersive HD Blu-ray audio in 2023, #EvilDeadRise is number 2 behind Oppenheimer and with titles like The Creator, Avatar, Mission: Impossible, Prey and other great sounding movies on the list! ğŸ™â¤ï¸ğŸ”Š #proudsounddesigner"";-1
"Felt like I heard this before until the last part, never watched the episode in English before but seems like VA did a great job, and what a great combination with Oppenheimer.   I will die on the hill that this episode of AoT was one of the best episodes ever made."";-1
"Easily the best film of 2023 along with Oppenheimer in my opinion. I wish Oppenheimer and Godzilla minus one released together instead of Barbie, because it essentially feels like a prequel to Minus one, and the experience of watching it will be better after watching Oppenheimer."";-1
eriously - #Seattle doing its best #Oppenheimer impersonation. Crazy like a mushroom cloud blowing up on @KING5Seattle New Year at the Needle;-1
f the poor things score by jerskin fendrix doesn't win best score i will riot like oppenheimer is cute but poor things is the best;-1
"I get no one actually hates Oppenheimer. Iâ€™m just sayin itâ€™s a modern biopic that I love. And when people say this genre is all Oscar bait and sucks I feel like theyâ€™re forgetting about the 2 best movies of the year (Oppenheimer, Killers of the flower moon)"";-1
"Oppenheimer is one movie this year that shocked me to my core, it is such a primal movie that I canâ€™t explain it..it felt like I was being shook awake and told to stare at what happened, one of the best movies of this year and of all time"";1
"2. Oppenheimer One of the 21st centuries greatest films, Oppenheimer tackles a man's life like no other. Never have I seen a life captured as perfectly in a movie as Nolan does here. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. & Christopher Nolan deliver career best work."";1
"no Oppenheimer for me personally, some of nolans quirks just annoy me as a director and I felt like alot of the runtime focused on less interesting parts of his story but theres definitely a few standout moments and scenes that are some of the best ive seen this year"";-1
ext up Oppenheimer!! I couldnâ€™t go to the premiere so I went to see it in the best format possible at the science museum!! kinda fitting tbh but also itâ€™s really good ğŸ˜Š my friends didnâ€™t like it but I was so invested that I didnâ€™t realise that the 3hrs runtime was done;-1
"Not the best year for movies for me (havenâ€™t even seen Oppenheimer yet!), gonna go with ATSV by default. What else did I really like? GOTG? Asteroid City? Theater Camp? Iâ€™ve definitely shifted waaaay in favor of watching more TV than movies"";-1
hat Brian has said is true. Majority of the time the showier role wins. But what Cillian has in his favour is the best picture push. Oppenheimer is the stronger to win so he may go along with the film (like Michelle Yeoh/JLC last year).;-1
ost fun I had? Super Mario Bros Best movies? Oppenheimer and Poor Things Sleeper hit I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d like but ended up loving? Saltburn;-1
"Oppenheimer was a magnificent epic drama. Barbie was a fun, yet message heavy comedy but #TheHoldovers is just a well acted, perfect story. I love going from a great movie like Saltburn to another that hits just right. Although I have more to see, this is what should win best pic"";1
'm sure best actor will come down to Cooper vs Murphy. I prefer Murphy because again Oppenheimer felt like more of a character rather than an impression.   But after seeing Ferrari this week I have no idea why Driver isn't right in the middle of the best actor conversation.;-1
"Best movies of the year:  Oppenheimer - Masterpiece in every sense. Incredible visuals, music, performances. A movie that seems like it couldn't possible live up to the hype, yet somehow it did."";-1
onka as best movie? Did you like Barbie or Oppenheimer? Nuts!!!  Godzilla minus one IS the damn jewel of the year!!  Now I wanna draw a Godzilla to be honest *w*);-1
pocalypse Now and Network are my benchmarks for greatness. And Godfather of course. Training Day was my best script to date. Iâ€™d be lucky to have another script like that in me. ğŸ™ğŸ¼  Edit: and Oppenheimer. Astounding film.;-1
"just a few things to address: 1) nominating anyone from oppenheimer for the maya hawke award is a total misunderstanding of the category 2) saltburn is very clearly a â€œmost musicâ€ contender, as is guardians (two movies i like) 3) matt bomer should be in best drums, sorry"";-1
robably in best picture and I still have Oppenheimer taking director along with tech just like Gravity and Saving Private Ryan.;-1
"5. Oppenheimer  My second favorite film of this year, it's in my opinion Christopher Nolan's best film. His ability to make such an empathetic yet critical film about Oppenheimer is legitimately impressive. The production design is also mind-boggling, like how did they do that?"";1
"I still need to see that, Zone of Interest, Rustin and Poor Things. I haven't seen Barbie or Ferrari either. American Fiction was great, but I liked Past Lives best - I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I wanted to like Oppenheimer but just didn't."";-1
"Bro the 2 best movies this year from 2 of the best directors are Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon...  Notice something they have in common? Like certain themes, perhaps?"";-1
 liked Oppenheimer a lot. But generally the earlier films I like best.;1
ppenheimer has got to have been the best movie of 2023!!! like whaaaattt ğŸ¤¯;1
y best film of 2023?  Oppenheimer.  It seems like there was scarcely any competition. (Barbie a close run second obviously);1
"Oppenheimer. My first IMAX screening ever that too with my best friend and I donâ€™t think that feeling of the theatre in that auditorium will ever be recreated again. The thrill, the silence and the poignancy, i never had a cinema experience like that before."";1
eep thinking about Oppenheimer. That movie has like 5 or 6 best supporting actor/actress performances of the year.;1
"You could listen to the best of once, or watch Oppenheimer 3 times like @JeffDLowe"";-1
've got to get my ass to the theater this week.  Oppenheimer rewatch (x3) cemented it's #1 spot as best movie of the year for me. Maestro was decent but I wasn't blown away like others.;1
 imagine the guy who pitched this was like holy shit when it worked and then he had to quickly put together a team of the best scientists to turn his dream into reality like in Oppenheimer;-1
his like when Oppenheimer called the best of the best to make the bomb;-1
"2023 recap: At the risk of sounding like a basic bro, my best movie and TV series of the year are Oppenheimer and Succession Season 4."";-1
 am now in agreement with other real SF/F/H geeks like me: GODZILLA MINUS ONE was the best film of the year. (Second was OPPENHEIMER.);-1
"Oppenheimer (well, for me) is the best movie of 2023. It gave me the best cinematic experience and many unexplainable feelings. Check out my movie review! Don't forget to like and subscribe! #oppenheimer #oppenheimerchristophernolan #moviereview https://youtu.be/PYeqfZ32e3c"";1
"It's not insane to think Josh Hartnett was acting his ass OFF in Oppenheimer, right? Like the 3rd best after Cillian and Downey?"";-1
 didnâ€™t like oppenheimer just bc of cillian but that was a massive plus the movie itself was amazing even though i didnâ€™t understand half of it and if it doesnâ€™t win golden globe for best soundtrack iâ€™ll kms;-1
y top movies of the year are:  1. Oppenheimer 2. John Wick Chapter 4 3. Asteroid City 4. Killers of the Flower Moon 5. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar 6. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One 7. May December   Nothing below 7 feels like it belongs on a Best Of list.;-1
""While I donâ€™t necessarily disagree, I think there is a distinction that can be made between â€œbestâ€ and â€œfavoriteâ€.  For example, I like and enjoy Wonka more than Oppenheimer, but I think Oppenheimer is a better made movie with better acting, etc."";-1

"Watched OPPENHEIMER tonight. Observations:  1. Itâ€™s a flippen brilliant movie with a kick-ass cast who bring it at every turn. 2. Americaâ€™s hubris packaged as patriotism will destroy the world. They gambled humanity on a near zero once, what makes us think they wonâ€™t do it again."";-1

skipped a morning of work to watch an 8:15am IMAX 70mm showing of Oppenheimer lol I am still so stunned at what I watched. The levels of intensity throughout the film were remarkable. Didnâ€™t necessarily have to follow every word to feel the level of high stakes for each character;-1
I have neither watched barbie nor oppenheimer.;-1

my friend who has watched Oppenheimer was talking about cillian murphy and how in one scene heâ€™s wearing a super tight shirt so she yelled â€œskimsâ€ in the theatre AND WHEN I TELL YOU THE TEACHER KICKED ME OUT OF THE CLASS BECAUSE I COULDNâ€™T STOP LAUGHING;-1
i couldnâ€™t care less ab the barbie movie cause i never really cared ab the movies as a kid? i told my coworkers at work that i watched oppenheimer and that i was more excited for that than barbie and she started shit like â€barbie is so culturally significantâ€œ   like?????? ok cool;-1
Have seen Oppenheimer twice;-1
can someone with access to Christopher Nolan ask him if he watched Numb3rs before making Oppenheimer? inquiring minds (me) need to know;-1
Is it bad that I still havenâ€™t watched Oppenheimer?;-1
""I watched Oppenheimer yesterday, amazing film. But after all, Christopher Nolan never makes a bad movie"";1
""Went to see Oppenheimer again, this time taking my dad with me. Itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve watched a film twice at the cinema!"";-1
ive watched oppenheimer and its one of the best movies ive ever seen.;1

I WATCHED OPPENHEIMER;-1
""Watched Oppenheimer last night and really enjoyed it. But, it was WAY TOO LONG! No movie should be more than 3 hours long unless itâ€™s a The Lord of the Rings movie or a James Cameron film.   Yeah, I said what I said."";-1
""Absolute W take from @madhooker - if anyone thinks that the movie 'idolises' Oppenheimer, they're either blind or are willingly hating on it because of some weird moral compass dictated by the media. They surely haven't watched the same movie."";-1
These were all questions that I asked myself when I watched Oppenheimer and it made me realize just how deeply his and the fellow scientists at Los Alamos legacy still shapes our world. It is a legacy that we still havenâ€™t comes to terms with and perhaps never will.;-1
Just watched the new Oppenheimer movie. The parallels between the Deep State going after Oppenheimer and Deep State going after Trump are the same. Some things just never change.;-1
Finally watched Oppenheimer and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. #openheimer;1
""I watched OPPENHEIMER this afternoon. I enjoyed it! While the reviews saying """"it's 3 hours of talking"""" aren't wrong, it was still engaging viewing. Considering how easily I fall asleep these days, it's good sign I made it through the whole 3 hours without nodding off ğŸ˜‚"";-1
watched oppenheimer. why did niels bohr sound like that;-1
""Oppenheimer is solely the American viewpoint of ww2.   (Long time back, I watched this hindi movie Aman before I knew about WW2. It was devastating to watch even as a detached third person viewpoint.)  Might is not right, wish that message had been strong."";-1
Well I watched Oppenheimer today and it was great and all but at a huge cost because i severely underestimated how long it was and it is now 11:30 in the night ğŸ¥² good night guys ğŸ¥²ğŸ¥²;1
watched oppenheimer finally and it might be the best thing i have ever seen. it's like if the secret history and the good wife made a baby together. and also neils bohr is there;1
Watched Oppenheimer yesterday - and will watch the Barbie Movie today wearing my pink coloured @LCFC 'Monday' socks ğŸ¦ŠğŸ˜€ğŸ˜… #Barbenheimmer;-1

watched oppenheimer for the comedic relief now itâ€™s time for real cinema;-1
""Just watched #Oppenheimer film and I am deeply disturbed by the blatant disrespect shown towards the Bhagavad Gita. To use a sacred Sanskrit scripture, revered by millions, in an intimate scene is utterly shameful. The scene where a naked woman holds the scripture text in front of her chest during an intimate act with Oppenheimer is particularly objectionable. Why is it deemed acceptable to misuse a sacred Hindu text in this manner? Would the filmmakers consider using sacred scriptures from other religions in such an offensive and disrespectful way?"";-1
finally watched oppenheimer. i don't think any film has made me feel the same way.;0
Finally watched oppenheimerğŸ˜‹;-1
People would have watched MI over Indy. And tbf itâ€™s Barbie damaging MI and Oppenheimer (just because itâ€™s been a craze ğŸ¤£);-1

""i watched the oppenheimer, at first i thought he was on drugs idk"";-1
cant believe people watched this and their main takeaway is that nolan loves oppenheimer and we're supposed to think he was a great guy..??? did i watch the same movie??;-1
I havenâ€™t watched â€œOppenheimerâ€ yet Did I miss something?;-1
my mom watched oppenheimer before me;-1
""obviously Oppenheimer and Barbie are up there, but this changed my life when i watched it this month."";-1
Watched Oppenheimer. Thought it was going to be a interesting physics movie. Turns out itâ€™s about how corrupt the government is and how much they hate the citizens.;-1
just watched oppenheimer. now i just need someone to watch barbie with;-1
A popular source tells Barack Obama didn't watched Oppenheimer because he was saving money for Leo FDFS;-1

""10. Shuâ€™s brain is very attractive- 11. I thought James and Sera was d-word after theyâ€™re being shot. 12. Probably because I just watched Oppenheimer (2023) with its heavy topic today, I couldnâ€™t fully process the information in this movie, huhu.  Overall, itâ€™s 9/10 from me."";-1
Haven't watched Barbie (so busy)  But I can't imagine it being better that Oppenheimer (Id love to be proven wrong);-1
Very confused by people who watched Oppenheimer and came away with the impression that Oppenheimer single handily built the bomb as a work of genius that wouldnâ€™t have happened without him;-1
Loved Oppenheimer but the demeanour of those leaving after watching it and those who have just watched Barbie is quite marked.;-1
watched oppenheimer for the second time i donâ€™t know how to feel anymore;-1
It's a boring movie. I have almost watched most of Nolan's filmography. Oppenheimer comes at the bottom for me. Flim worked because of the marketing gimmick. Release it with normal circumstances it won't be as big as it is portrayed now.;0
""I just watched Oppenheimer in the cinema, it was fucking amazing"";1
""Watched #Oppenheimer yesterday. Letâ€™s just say, I hate when people clap after a movie. I look around and judge ğŸ™„  But DAMN, this movie made me want to clap!! ğŸ¥´ Cillian Murphy and the entire cast was incredible. The entire movie was so thrilling.   #Villafanamoviereview - A"";1
Yeah I haven't watched oppenheimer yet it comes out in august here;-1
#Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time ğŸ‘Œ;1
Watched #Oppenheimer;-1
""What isnâ€™t lol  You got inception, the prestige, Momento, interstellar, Dunkirk, and Iâ€™m sure Oppenheimer is just as good havenâ€™t watched it yet"";-1
""Just watched the movie this last weekend, it's not really about the bomb project or who is credited for it. The movie is about Oppenheimer and his relations/controversy before and after the project as well as the mortality of using such a weapon."";-1
Watched Oppenheimer again last night. That final scene really is haunting;1
""I watched the Oppenheimer movie, so there.  I also stayed in a Holiday Inn Express last night, even better."";-1
me when i haven't watched oppenheimer;-1
Watched the sold out line at IMAX to see Oppenheimer...$75 a ticket. ğŸ˜¯ğŸ¥³ğŸ‘ğŸ‘..Soon  a similar movie to go into production on FAUCCI...ğŸ¤¢â˜¹ï¸ğŸ‘Š;-1
i watched oppenheimer! and started playing hsr! and almost forced my brother to do a star wars marathon with me lifes great  i want to stab someone;-1
Oppenheimer is the ultimate example of status signalling. The film makers sold it as a film which signals high intellect. While in reality it's a boring 3 hour average film which makes you dooze off to sleep.   People watched it just to portray themselves as intelligent.;-1
""Watched 'Oppenheimer' yesterday. A thrilling biography laced with amazing acting and thumping background score. Despite being a three-hour long movie, it doesn't lag anywhere. Quite fast paced to keep you on the edge of your seat. A groundbreaking achievement for Nolan."";-1
Talk to me! Watched Oppenheimer for the first time today in 70mm and rewatching Barbie on wednesday ğŸ˜Œ;-1
What did you think of oppenheimer? Iâ€™m still bouncing back and forth between watching it or not. Also I have a recommendation since you enjoy le movies. Watch The Truman Show if you havenâ€™t already. I watched it yesterday and it was absolutely amazing.;1
Watched in the anticipation of Oppenheimer. ğŸ˜­;-1
We will also talk about Oppenheimer because I watched it this weekend;-1
I watched both of them back to back by watching Tenet right before I saw Oppenheimer in IMAX. It really is an epic double feature!;-1
""I watched both Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both are good, but I prefer Oppenheimer instead."";1
Absolutely! I watched it after reading the bio before seeing the film and again after the film and gleaned something different both times. I can't wait to rewatch Oppenheimer!;1
#RockyAurRaniKiPremKahani Don't go with reviewers. I'm telling you I've watched #Oppenheimer and #RockyAurRaniKiPremKahani  back to back and believe me they both deserves #Oscars and #Filmfare Respectively. Both are worth watching.;-1
""Watched Oppenheimer, Barbie, They Cloned Tyrone e Bird Box Barcelona.  Favorite: Oppenheimer."";-1
""Watched Oppenheimer on Friday ğŸ¬ğŸ¿, and let me tell you, it was SUCH a light-hearted, feel-good film! Who doesn't love spending the next two days pondering the joys of a nuclear holocaust? ğŸ˜… #CasualWeekendThoughts #NuclearNightmares â˜¢ï¸ğŸš€ğŸ’£ğŸ’¥â˜ ï¸"";-1
Watched 'Oppenheimer today'. Absolutely brilliant film imo. Cillian Murphy is excellent in lead role. The historical and political context is engrossing and the cinematography is impressive. A long film so you may need a cushion and definitely a 'just in case' wee beforehand!;-1
So just watched #Oppenheimer and wow all i can this movie is a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word. this movie 100% Deserves 10/10 score becuse it is that good.  And i  implore you to see it in IMAX if you can.;-1
""OMG LEXI, your brain is MASSIVE, I loved everything about this !!!! I havenâ€™t watched the movie yet (fucking Italy delayed the release date ğŸ˜”ğŸ˜”), I canâ€™t wait to know more about these parallels between Kaveh and Oppenheimer!!!"";-1
""Watched #Oppenheimer over the weekend. Powerful, heavy, & thought provocative movie that resonates with today's state of world affairs & the influence of our military industrial complex. I recommend it, but anyone who says that it is a seamless 3 hour watch would be lying to you."";-1
Pov: you watched oppenheimer ğŸ˜­;-1
""Watched #Oppenheimer this weekend. Not a very effect-heavy film, but glad I saw it in the theater. A great story and a much-needed reminder of how fragile this world is and how easy it is to tip it off balance. Cillian Murphy is fantastic. Love the scene with Einstein in the end."";-1
guys i watched oppenheimer last night and i was correct;-1
""Unofficially ended my degree today. 5 years staying in Sabah. Today we went to eat mee kung fu in the afternoon, watched Oppenheimer in the evening, ate seafood at night, had buah tarap, buah durian, & buah salak as supper. I'm so full today."";-1
my cousin who watched oppenheimer in English with french subs and his ass don't understand neither of them ğŸ˜­;-1
""all watched in the theatre, weâ€™re so back   Barbie  Mission: Impossible â€” Dead Reckoning Oppenheimer  Past Lives"";-1
""It was fun to start with Barbie, and then be focused on a real story like Oppenheimer  I kinda liked doing that even if it was weird to chain the two ! Tonight I may upload my ranking of all movies and TV shows I've watched in 2023 as of now :)"";-1
Finally watched this and I LOVED it. A great pallet cleanser after the existential crisis you get from watching Oppenheimer;1
""I watched oppenheimer today and finished the barbenheimer experience Gotta say its was the most Mojo Dojo Casa House film i have seen this year, even more mojo dojo casa than the batman"";-1
""Loved Oppenheimer Movie. Watched the PBS special documentary on him this weekend, filmed in 2009. Somehow they felt like the same thing."";-1
""Watched Barbie and Oppenheimer over the weekend. Barbie was movie yang tah apa apa.  Oppenheimer was just a documentary on steroids. Without that music and bursts of stars or fire in between scenes, it was just a documentary."";-1
This is the down side of barbenheimer. People that see 2 movies a year watched Oppenheimer. And a 3hr long masterpiece is boring to them;-1
ust watched Oppenheimer and can finally read shitty reductive twt discourse â¤ï¸İ
historical documentaries > historical movies btw I watched a 30 min documentary on Oppenheimer and I really don't know what a movie that's 6 times as long can add to the knowledge that it gave me;-1
Watched Oppenheimer last night it was phenomenal;1
cant believe i havenâ€™t watched Oppenheimer yet;-1
Watched Oppenheimer yesterday and dat shit was LOUD...  Good movie though.;1
""Oh, and after Barbie and Oppenheimer, @RoKhanna watched another 3-hour Hindi rom-com, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani. So 8 hours at the cinema over the weekend, but not a single word on Manipur. Is this what standing for universal human rights looks like?"";-1
So Katie watched Oppenheimer? Not surprised she did. ğŸ’œğŸ¤“ Looks like I have to watch it as well sometime soon. ğŸ˜†;-1

oppenheimer is one of the best movies iâ€™ve watched;1
just watched oppenheimer for the third time and ill never understand how people try using the runtime as a gag like it flys by so fast;1
""I was surprised by how much I liked Oppenheimer, I already knew Iâ€™d enjoy Barbie. My only lament is that I watched Oppenheimer first. Any way #Barbenheimer complete! Cinema is back baybee!"";1
""#Oppenheimer triggered my emotions. My eyes got teary when I watched the detonation scene. Fear grappled me with the thought of me, my family or my children being consumed by the roaring flame of the bomb. It's a horror film closest to our reality. 1/2"";-1
feel like such a rebel. haven't watched barbie or oppenheimer ğŸ™ƒ;-1
""July Recap  -Got my color pencils (not exactly prismacolor but works)  -Watched Oppenheimer (Great movie, love itâ€™s theme)  Overall really mid month. But Iâ€™m really sorry for not posting actual art. Iâ€™ve been super lazy unfortunately. August will (hopefully) be better! :)"";-1
""I saw Oppenheimer last night. Good film, great insight on several topics. BUTâ€¦as I watched past the actual bomb going off, the movie for me got even more real. They might as well call the last third DJT. They are doing to him EXACTLY what they did to Oppenheimer. Those in power, lying, setting up situations, not having trials but having â€œinvestigations where evidence is not presented fairly, leaking what they made upâ€¦the list goes on and on. In this movie they wanted to remove Oppenheimerâ€™s opinions from the public because it was different than their controlling narratives.  The movie makes a condemnation of the manipulation of our injustice system. It makes a good case for free speech. It provides a magnificent insight as to how this worksâ€¦. Itâ€™s up to the people as to whether we allow it to continue like this!"";-1
""Can't lie every single minute of Oppenheimer is magic , watched it imax and non imax but didn't feel a huge difference"";-1

Watched Oppenheimer over the weekend. The nuclear program cost $2b in the 1940s.   I doubt they can pull off such a massive program in modern Nigeria. The rentier and grift system means theyâ€™d loot most of the money with very little to show for it.;-1

I haven't watched oppenheimer yet;-1
watched oppenheimer but was spacing out for half of it so i didn't get it;-1
Watched #Oppenheimer . Good movie. Better knowing the history of Oppenheimer before going to the theatre.;1

""Happy birthday papa ,  Whatever I do in life (Good , Bad) will be always incomplete without your presence though with time the realization of your physical absence feels less difficult to bear but still miles to go before we sleep.  Last week , I watched a movie """"Oppenheimer"""" based on the life of a physicist. I struck a chord immediately with the characters as a proud son of a physicist. I know physics and science are always your first love and remain till your last moment. (I Remember even in your very complex medical condition , you try to talk to doctors regarding Science).  Sometimes , I feel your grandson is exactly like you -Full of curiosity and excitement . He often ask me """"Dadu Kab aaige"""" , i often reply """"Dadu is with God and taking care of us all from heaven"""".  Papa , will always miss you   --"";-1

one thing i realised is that no one is ready to take any criticism whatsoever on oppenheimer. seems like there's a universal agreement to defend and celebrate this movie even before it was watched. also makes me wonder how many of these people really liked it for how it was.;-1
leaving the cinema clearly having not watched Oppenheimer;-1

I watched the #HauntedMansion movie on Sunday and it was really good. It focuses on humans and their grief of losing their loved ones. It isn't doing poorly at the box office because it sucked. It is doing poorly because of Barbie and Oppenheimer. It will do great on Disney+!;-1

saw barbie again bc I just had to. also watched oppenheimer & talk to me. talk to me wasnâ€™t scary but it was very entertaining and had shock value which I can always appreciate;-1

""Let me take your mind off from today's exploits and vyper talks for a bit.  Watched Oppenheimer today. It is truly one of the best movies I have watched. One thing that stuck with me, which can be related to LLMs, web3, worldcoin, and all the new tech in general, was a very minute detail.  Once the Trinity experiment was complete, the lab was basically closed. At that moment, one of the colonel/army guys said this to Oppenheimer: """"You did your part, now let us handle from here."""" The idea that scientists and researchers build WMDs and world changing tech, but then are not considered to be part of any talks regarding the policies or how to use that tech is the greatest danger to mankind.  Imagine building worldcoin as the world's goto tech for proof of personhood, but then governments, companies, and everyone start using it to classify people + their credit scores + how good of a citizen they are. Truly dystopian? Kinda like a black mirror episode.  Not saying worldcoin is wrong not to try to achieve the advancement of tech. If not them, someone else will. I'm just saying what can truly be done by the govts. Same goes for AI and crypto. They will just be the fuel to fire, and the masses won't have a say in how it is used.  A truly dystopian society is not just because of one company or tech. It will be because many companies will develop truly great things, and then governments end up using it for their own agendas."";-1
""wonder if Oppenheimer will give a resurgence to Dr. Strangelove? Eh, probably not. I'll bet half these retards watched Barbie first so they fell asleep to a movie that's mostly a bunch of guys in a room talking."";-1

This video is just a joke vid where she explains Oppenheimer in girly language. All her other videos are just her explaining concepts most people don't understand in a very girly and hyper-fem persona. The first video I watched of her she was explaining a lot of economic stuff;-1
I just finally watched the Oppenheimer trailer and this is crazy af that this actually happened and that someoneâ€™s brain thought of making this;-1
omg i just watched barbie and i wanna watch oppenheimer so bad;-1
""Just because you watched Oppenheimer doesnâ€™t make you a scientist bro. You major in business administration, sit down."";-1
no because i audibly GASPED when i watched oppenheimer in 70mm imax and the film started. iâ€™ve never been to imax before that and in that moment i genuinely felt like it was my first time seeing a movie EVER. couldnâ€™t believe my eyes;-1
""Oppenheimer was far and beyond what I imagined it was going to be. Still wrapping my head around what I watched. So many great performances, Cillian Murphy is phenomenal but Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss just stays with you."";-1

""How many movies you have watched - Oppenheimer, Barbie, New Mission Impossible"";-1
""Finally watched Oppenheimer today  It feels... weird Seeing these stories unfold  It doesn't feel real when you read about all those things that happened way before you were even born  But this movie was a great depiction of them. So great that it made me really feel and understand how this story is real  How those great, troubled, corrupt, brave, selfish and selfless men did the impossible and saved the world we live in today  We look back pragmatically on those decisions and in a purely strategic point of view it all makes sense.  All those decisions were necessary for """"good"""" to prevail against """"evil"""". But how many of us would actually make the same decisions?  Oppenheimer was somewhat indecisive, he had an internal struggle. But still did what had to be done...  All those colonels, generals, scientists, politicians... They made undreamed sacrifices, even if they were flawed/terrible people in other aspects of life.  Oppenheimer was a communist, or atleast a sympathizer to the cause -  something I usually despise in a person given all the information available they have for free on the internet today.  He was a cheater, broke the sanctity of marriage and the trust of a woman who loved him dearly.  He tried to commit homicide against his teacher for God's sake.  Yet... he was a brilliant man who most people - including me - admire.  Yes, he was a product of his time and company maybe, but the point is: he was a flawed man that proved as best as possible how you can't judge anyone in a binary way... It's impossible.  Maybe the most important man in the history of the world.  Yes, maybe his creation will mean the end of humanity as we know it.  But if he hadn't done it, it's likely we (humanity) wouldn't live to see 2023.  We would most definitely NOT be here trying to make money online in the great, albeit flawed, free world.  I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't experience the love of my father, my mother, and my brother. And I wouldn't be living the life of my dreams with my soulmate fiancÃ©e.   None of this wouldn't be real... and it all goes back to this man's story - a story that absolutely doesn't feel real to me.  This movie was great because it helped me feel how real it was. And how grateful I am that it went down this way...  Even though our world today is very flawed and a lot of today's problems stem back from these sorts of war stories throughout history...  Maybe humanity just did its best with the hands it was dealt  And that's a chilling thought"";-1
i canâ€™t believe she deleted this because after having just watched oppenheimer this is so true;-1

One thing about the Oppenheimer stuff that is interesting to me is that a lot of anger people feel toward it seems to be because it might be the first time theyâ€™ve watched a political film that is not centered in talking about identity.;-1

Wonder if its the downward spiral for mcu flicks? Have we finally reached a point where people are bored with these stories? I hope not but also canâ€™t blame them. Oppenheimer doing so well is a great sign at the same time. I watched in imax 70mm. Trying to watch that again ASAP!;-1

Now that I watched Oppenheimer let me just say that the discourse over not showing the bombing in the movie was absolutely idiotic. Not showing it was actually purposeful because it puts us in the same position as Oppy who only found out the bomb was deployed via radio.;-1

""Just watched Oppenheimer. Itâ€™s another classic from Nolan.From the film score to the visuals, a classic ğŸ‘Œ  Although I know the history of the subject itâ€™s a great telling, recommend ğŸ‘"";-1
""Watched #Oppenheimer the other day, wouldn't it be really funny if the movie cut to black, said 80 years later and then showed Kim Jong Un hovering over the nuclear button and then """"to be continued..."""""";-1
JUST WATCHED OPPENHEIMER IM FOREVER CHANGED BUT ATKINS MASTERCLASS LETS GO;-1
Oppenheimer: Not Watched. You literally admitted that you checked out halfway through the movie. LOL.;-1
Hey there you wonderful folks.   I watched Oppenheimer this weekend and (SPOILER ALERT) I loved it.   #Oppenheimer #Oppenheimerreview #OppenheimerMovie #Oppenheimermoviereview #ChristopherNolan #CillianMurphy  Check out my review here: https://www.spreaker.com/episode/56312117;-1
still havenâ€™t watched barbieâ€¦ or oppenheimerâ€¦;-1
JUST WATCHED OPPENHEIMER;-1
""Watched Oppenheimer. It was good! Not great, but good.   Bit bloated, awkward dialogue in places and underdeveloped female characters, but when it hit it fucking hit."";1
Finally watched Oppenheimer;-1
Just watched Oppenheimer. First thoughts after watching the movie. It was very loud. My ears hurtâ€¦;-1
Just watched Oppenheimer. Very good. ğŸ‘;1
Just watched Oppenheimer and was pleasantly surprised by Nolan's restraint during That Scene. A very awe-inducing quiet scene  and then the shock wave hit and now I'm deaf;-1
I know Cilian from â€œPeaky blindersâ€. My brother watched that show and loved him so much but I loved him from Oppenheimer ğŸ˜  I was shocked when I saw Rami thereğŸ˜‚ and I thought he is going to be bad character but he surprised me at the end ğŸ˜†;-1
I've watched Oppenheimer 3 times and the film still gives me chills;1
""Just watched Oppenheimer. Loved it. However, atomic bomb this, atomic bomb that. THIS was the most shocking thing in it."";1
""Finally watched Oppenheimer. The third act is the stuff of legends. Emily Blunt, you rocked my world"";-1
So I finally watched Oppenheimerâ€¦ Nolan I still love you;1
Also just watched & couldnâ€™t agree moreâ€¦ watched Barbie this afternoon & now They Cloned Tyroneâ€¦.. absolutely fantastic days worth of movie entertainment! ğŸ¿ğŸ˜€ - I will get round to Oppenheimer! ğŸ˜†;-1
Just watched Oppenheimer.  I guess nerds CAN fuck!;-1
""LETS GO VON HAVE FUN, i watched barbie the other day it was so funny, i wanna watch oppenheimer too but i suck so bad at watching long movies ong"";-1
""Finally watched Oppenheimer today. Itâ€™s a triumph of editing, soundtrack and Cillian Murphyâ€™s bone structure. I couldâ€™ve sat through three more hours."";-1
I actually had a good day today. Watched Oppenheimer and stuff. Wont go into detail since you know bird app nobody cares but yeah good day :);-1
Damn watched Oppenheimer again;-1
""Chilling day, Oppenheimer is a good movie but really hard for me to follow, I got headache after I watched the IMAX version @OppenheimerFilm"";-1
Finally watched #Oppenheimer. ğŸ˜;-1
Just watched Oppenheimer ...Mind blowing;1
How does Barbie hold up against Oppenheimer?  Using the JOC metric (jerk off-able content)  Times jerked off during Barbie: 12 times (Counted 31 scenes that are JOC)  Times jerked off during Oppenheimer: 4 times (Counted 4 JOC total)  I watched Oppenheimer right after Barbie;-1
""I've just recently watched Oppenheimer,I really love that movie and with the fact that it was directed by Christopher Nolan,the guy behind the dark knight movies.  Also I have to shield my eyes during the atomic bomb exploding scene due to its exaggerated brightness."";-1
""watched oppenheimer, don't know why bro did all that"";-1
""So I watched #Oppenheimer getting my thoughts together. Realize we're all flawed. Even the most brilliant minds make mistakes. And the beginning of the world might be God's plan, but the end might definitely have a lot to do with everything that is human. #sundayvibes"";-1
""It's insane how Oppenheimer and Barbie (Is there a name for that combo? Wild how no one made one yetâ€¦) are connected in ANY way.  I just watched Oppie, and loved it, but it's one of the most male, Bechdel test failing, least diverse films I've seen and feels soooo anti-Barbie ğŸ˜…"";-1
Just watched Oppenheimer;-1
i just watched oppenheimer im kind of speechless;-1
I havent watched oppenheimer yet;-1
A week ago Friday I hit Oppenheimer then Barbie and the next film I watched was Man of Aran on YouTube and IT HURTS;-1
Just watched Oppenheimer and I totally loved it;1
Watched Oppenheimer and very good movie loved everything apart from the fact I couldn't hear a single fucking word but apart from that incredible last hour was by far the best;1
watched oppenheimer;-1
Espio definitely watched Oppenheimer;-1
oppenheimer was the most stressful movie iâ€™ve ever watched   oppenheimer/10;1
""just watched Oppenheimer. the story is important, but 3 hours important? one takaway from the Manhattan project that Nolan didn't embody is that deadlines work. otherwise, a masterpiece."";-1
""Oppenheimer, if you can go to an IMAX theatre. Barbie could be watched in any type of screen and still good, Oppie is also good, but there are some technical aspects better suited for IMAX."";-1
I belong to that 20% of population who haven't watched either Barbie or Oppenheimer yet ğŸ˜¢;-1
""Watched Oppenheimer today. I knew of the man and his involvement in the manhattan project, but to see the before and after was interesting. Iâ€™m going to learn more about him. The movie was engrossing. I didnâ€™t feel the time pass!"";-1
""Just watched Oppenheimer and like...bro, if yall like that type shit, yall gotta see it."";-1
Iâ€™ve watched the series manhattan and the character Oppenheimer is in it. He was crazy ğŸ˜‚;-1
""Oppenheimer is a gorgeous, immaculately written, wondrously acted movie I watched and will never ever ever ever need to see again. Nolan is a magician, and pretentious as fuck and badly in need of an editor."";-1
""Finally watched Oppenheimer, this movie is a masterpiece, everything about it is amazing, it's a must to watch in a theater"";1
Just watched oppenheimer #what the hell man;-1
have you watched oppenheimer;-1
how yâ€™all watched oppenheimer;-1
just watched oppenheimer i am a changed persom;-1
""To be real. Even as i watched oppenheimer the only time the audience at my theatre laughed together, though there were many places for humor and a giggle, was a Marvel level dialogue. Sad to say, this country is conditioned. Satyajit Ray's judgement reigns true today too."";-1
i made my twin watch barbie with me when i watched it for the 2nd time (he hates ryan gosling and hated him in the movie even more ğŸ˜­) and now im gonna make him watch the crappy version of oppenheimer so yea gworlbosses always win in the end;-1
watched oppenheimer 1 hour was useless;-1
""Read too much about Oppenheimer, its like I already watched it"";-1
i watched oppenheimer a second time today and it truly fascinates me how colossally fucked up a whole bunch of educated scientists can be to support and be happy about such a catastrophe given that theyâ€™re the one group of society that people swear are the most sensible;-1
Watched Barbie  I could hear the Oppenheimer bomb vibration from my seat;-1
""Just watched Oppenheimer, a vvvv good movie & for 3 hours, didnâ€™t feel prolonged. Just wanna know why he was always after everyone elseâ€™s wife???"";-1
just watched oppenheimer;-1
Sad to report that I watched Oppenheimer like this;-1
""Just watched Oppenheimer with my friends. Freud was mentioned twice, and Jung was mentioned once, and the entire row turned and stared at me all three times with smiles on their faces."";-1
""first thing my parents said after we watched Oppenheimer was """"didn't feel like three hours."""" long films are super rewarding!"";-1
Just watched Oppenheimer 10/10 fs the bomb test tho was lowkey overhyped still visually appealing tho;1
Anyone watched Oppenheimer yet?;-1
He already watched Oppenheimer tho;-1
""Honestly, I wish I watched Oppenheimer in IMAX. This girl is sending me snaps watching it in IMAX and my goodness. The quality of even the snaps? Imagine sitting there watching that film in 70mm IMAX?"";-1
""I felt the """"Oppenheimer"""" movie described the conclusion of the nuclear bomb very light and indirectly when I watched it, so I was a little bit disappointed. But I was more disappointed when I saw the tweet by the Barbie Movie."";-1
Hello @LicenceToQueer @calvindyson having watched Oppenheimer which was very good I just canâ€™t see Nolan being a good fit for a bond film. He looks done with linear story telling and it not being important to hear what actors are saying.;-1
Sry i was spontaniously treating myself with cinema. I watched Oppenheimer and loved it.  I missed both trends bc of it ğŸ˜­ But i felt so good today;-1
""Just watched Oppenheimer tonight, and boy what an eerie ending it had! ğŸ˜³ Do give it a viewing if you havenâ€™t already."";-1
watched & loved oppenheimer now iâ€™m deeply in my cillian era i got tired of looking & loving from afar;-1
just watched oppenheimer and that shit was GOOD;1
I have just watched Oppenheimer so i'm not capable of watching anything rn.;-1
""I need to watch Hiroshima, mon amour after having watched Oppenheimer"";-1
I just watched Oppenheimer a second time and I totally agree! A rewatch also helps if you were confused with the timeline and some names the first time (like me) ğŸ˜‚;-1
I watched oppenheimer last week its time for barbie;-1
""I watched Oppenheimer last night, it started at 11:30 and I took too many edibles, shit was scary asf"";-1
""Interstellar, The Dark Knight Rises,  The Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk, The Prestige, Oppenheimer & Memento in this order. TENET I didn't like it at all. Haven't watched Following & Insomnia yet."";-1
Oppenheimer was a 9/10. Probably the best movie Iâ€™ve watched all week   With that being said Iâ€™ve watched three Twilight movies this week and Iâ€™ve almost ****** myself during each one;1
I've watched all of their Oppenheimer interviews what do I do with my life now;-1
""Watched it on IMAX earlier today. Really enjoyed it, beautifully filmed. Think I would have preferred seeing more than Fuchs from the British delegation but it's about Oppenheimer and his post 2ww stuff. Great performances from the leads and supports."";-1
Just watched Oppenheimer.  You can afford skipping it. Nothing substantial. #Oppenheimer;-1
""For everyone that watched Oppenheimer I highly recommend to listen to Linkin Park's Album """" A Thousand Suns"""". It's a complement for the movie,the whole album have a strong message for all of us! Listen to it you won't be disappointed"";-1
""On a lighter note, Japanese watched Oppenheimer for free."";-1
2 things  I haven't watched Oppenheimer So I can go this weekend and watch with my dad  My brother doesn't go to theatres much So I can take him for this movie  I am confused rn;-1
Watched Oppenheimer last night  10/10 would drop the bomb again;1
""I watched Oppenheimer, what a movie!"";1
Is anyone watched oppenheimer?;-1
""No way buddy, I watched Oppenheimer last week. They were definitely real!!   ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚"";1
Oppenheimer - one of the best movie I've ever watched in cinema;1
Just watched Oppenheimer... IMAX is insane;1
Watched Oppenheimer today and its one of finest cinematic experiences i ever had!  Requires attention all the way but when it ends you know you witnessed some magic of cinema  Everybody nailed their performance even with tiny screen time And about Nolanâ€¦.@RGVzoominâ€™s words;-1
""Oppenheimer (2023)  What do I have to say? I think this movie is one of the best movies i've watched. Its almost a 10/10, the acting was great, I enjoyed the themes, and I was amazed by how Murphy and Damon acted."";1
I see someone watched Oppenheimer.;-1
""Tenet tonight, watched half last night, not a clue whatâ€™s happening.  Watched Interstellar again the other night, amazing film.  Think Insomnia will be next, Dunkirk, Oppenheimer & Following. Then rewatch the rest.  Christopher Nolan ğŸ‘ŒğŸ»"";-1
Oppenheimer can easily be watched alone its that kind of film;-1

""i watched oppenheimer today, honestly the last line just killed me"";-1
""Oppenheimer: from historical infamy to an unexplained popular apotheosis  Just about a week, I watched the film that dramatises the life of physicist Robert Oppenheimer. Including the due adaptation for summarising Oppenheimerâ€™s life and work, the movie shows great quality."";-1

The Two Movies Cillian Murphy Watched To Prepare For Oppenheimer #Movies dlvr.it/SsyTyk;-1
I have finally watched (and loved) #Oppenheimer. you may now continue with your memes and discourse.;1
Have you actually watched the movie? Because it very directly calls out Oppenheimer's hypocrisy and doesn't present a wholly sympathetic view of him.   Not to mention how anti-red scare and sympathetic to  communism it is.;-1
""watched oppenheimer, very cool and well-done movie, and i'm gonna be honest....... if your takeaway from the movie was """"gee that guy and everything he did was great!"""" you're an idiot"";-1
""I've not yet watched #Oppenheimer but being a science student I know how fission & fusion reactions work.  Also this piece clearly gives quite an insight to his life, in brief that is.   https://inv.tux.pizza/Xzv84ZdtlE0"";-1
""If thatâ€™s where your interests lie, you should watch Oppenheimer I think. (I havenâ€™t watched the movie myself but itâ€™s supposed to be amazing)"";-1

Finally watched Oppenheimer 10/10;1
""Just watched Oppenheimer for a 2nd time. Def my fav film of the year, and more importantly, ranked the appearances of our childhood stars that showed up. Josh Peck whispering â€œoh godâ€ gave me chills"";-1

Haven't watched Oppenheimer eitherğŸ˜­;-1

""Just watched Oppenheimer, clearly one of the mostly best movies I have seen till dateğŸ¬. The quality of storytelling and screenplay is just mind blowing ğŸ¤¯. It's a work of art which only an artist like Christopher Nolan can execute ğŸ’¯ #OppenheimerInIMAX #ChristopherNolan"";-1
Bro just wanted to tell that he has watched oppenheimer;-1
""Just watched #Oppenheimer ğŸ’£ , that film going straight into my Top 5 films of all time"";1
""I watched the Oppenheimer movie, it provided a good portrayal of the origins of Los Alamos and showcased some excellent acting by Cillian Murphy. I was expecting the movie to focus more on his genius rather than the political turmoil of his time. Itâ€™s still worth watching."";-1
""No, that OP never said that people watched Barbie because of Oppenheimer. You the one who started off saying that people watched Oppenheimer because of Barbie."";-1
Just watched Oppenheimer and YES it's f*in awesome. YES Ken is absolutely great in it. YES the cinematography and screenplay are MIND BLOWING. So if you were wondering... YES you should go see it!;1
if you already watched Oppenheimer i'll be very happy if you have a conversation with me cus im a bit confused ğŸ˜µâ€ğŸ’«;-1
For anyone who watched Oppenheimer and wanted a great and more importantly mathless introduction to quantum physics: read Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces. He was also portrayed in the movie (guy on the left).;-1
Itâ€™s that week where Iâ€™ve watched Barbie thrice and Oppenheimer once in the theatre.;-1
Just watched Oppenheimer;-1
""that's what my friend said,she was like """"i am not so sure if i would enjoy oppenheimer cuz that's not so """"me"""" ğŸ˜‚but then she came and said she enjoyed it so much but barbie got her so emotionally invested to the point where she started crying  Ps:i still haven't watched thoughğŸ¥²"";-1

""I was replying to the OP who claimed that alot of people watched Barbie cuz of Oppenheimer, I merely countered that Barbie has made more money, hence it seems more people were only interested in Oppenheimer cuz of Barbie's popularity, ergo I was right."";-1
haven't watched Oppenheimer yet so can't tell;-1
just watched oppenheimer. bro???????;-1
You said that people more wanted to watch Oppenheimer because of Barbie which isnâ€™t true at all. People were just trying to explain to you why more people watched Barbie. Barbieheimer helped BOTH movies.;-1
I watched interstellar yesterday and it was AMAZING next up is Oppenheimer;-1

""Short spoiler free Oppenheimer review cause i just watched it:  If youve watched a Cristopher Nolan movie before you should already expect it to be a cinematic masterpiece, as someone who really enjoys a movie on historic events i was extremely interested throughout, 1/2"";-1
""All Iâ€™ve been thinking about for the past week is how if this were 15 years ago, my paw paw would have gone and watched Oppenheimer while my Maw Maw took all of us to see Barbie.   Then we wouldâ€™ve snuck in towards the end to watch the rest of Oppenheimer."";-1

Oppenheimer if he watched cat videos instead of inventing the atomic bomb;-1
I JUST WATCHED OPPENHEIMER it was so good;1
Watched Oppenheimer today.;-1
watched Oppenheimer today and nolan definitely didn't disappoint. That last hour or so was absolutely breathtaking.;1
just watched oppenheimer. how tf do they not show what the entire movie is about? itâ€™s a sad thing but it really would put in perspective the entire point of the movie. the psychological and physical damage done to japan & their citizens was only mentioned briefly and not shown;-1

""watched Oppenheimer last night and when I tell you I was blown away by the score, writing and cinematography. The level of shock and awe is breathtaking, but it can also be taxing. This is a very heady, brainy spectacle. A thesis. A portrait of a genius, his triumphs and shame"";-1
Oppenheimer was fooking magnificent! Definitely the best movie of the year and the year hasn't ended yet. It was amazing from beginning to end. Holy fook. Needs to be watched on IMAX  #Oppenheimer;1

""Anyways, I watched Oppenheimer first then Barbie. Barbie is definitely enjoyable but Oppenheimer is a must watch for understanding a bit of history...and seeing America in a different light."";-1
""Watched the movie Oppenheimer.  Seems everyone get his or her own take on this history. Nuclear, communism sympathy, mixed with extraordinary talent.  Einsteinâ€™s chat with Oppenheimer was epic!  Glad America won the WW2!"";-1
Just Watched Oppenheimer in Cinemas i will Rate it 8.8 out of 10. Reason is its simply too long with the Tests being only  a very small part of the film.;1
""I just watched it all in a second, now I gotta ask, where's the hype come from? It's just a brown screen I mean clearly Oppenheimer is better, since at least that was a rickroll for 2 hours, which is more eventful than this trash."";-1
Watched Oppenheimer today. I was prepared to set aside my preconceived notions about American war movies. But no. So much American exceptionalism and nationalism that the movie wants you to think it questions but fails miserably in doing so.;-1
""And as @kdcloudy would agree, if you're in Delhi-NCR, watch Oppenheimer at PVR Logix, the biggest possible IMAX screen in and around the city. Nothing like it. Watched it already? Go for round 2. Just like I will."";-1

You like Interstellar more than Oppenheimer? I just watched Interstellar yesterday and at least my experience was way more positive with Oppenheimer;-1
Outstanding movie and performances!  Cillian Murphy was amazing in his portrayal of Oppenheimer. First 3 hour movie that Iâ€™ve watched in a theatre - it should win many awards;-1

Have you even watched Oppenheimer? The movie in no way justifies the bombings. Its tells the story from Oppieâ€™s perspective - the only reason why he was motivated to work on the project was the Nazis not building the bomb first - God knows what the Nazis would have done with it;-1
